Synopsis: <i class="fas fa-scroll"></i> "New World is a story that I received in my mind in 16/11/2016, about a new world for the humans to live in, a better world.<br />
New World was started on 04/06/2016, by a person, human, named Izaque Sanvezzo, or The Creator, or Creator Izaque, he had fourteen at that time.<br />
He lived in the city of Maringá, in the state of Paraná, in Brazil.<br />
Izaque was born in the city of Paranavaí in the same state and country.<br />
But a friend of his said that her parents were going to move to the city of Maringá.<br />
Izaque was very close to that friend of his, he accepted the offer, and told his parents.<br />
And this website (New World) explains about the story, a real story, not a theory.<br />
The story makes me happy when I think about it, knowing that something like that is going to happen in the future.<br />
That I am going to feel happy about myself and my body.<br />
I also think about it when I am sad about my life, like having the need to eat, drink, sleep, breathe, I think about a world where those things do not exist."<br />

New World was started on 05/06/2016, by a being, human, named Izaque Sanvezzo, or The Creator, or Creator Izaque, he had fourteen at that time.
<br />
<br />The Universe_ID of his universe was:
<br />1103704663492309979342203197340977346910466047411035906475503110378191614292021343658
<br />
<br />And his Being_ID was:
<br />9877216492287243892675429778242972071218922547872762642287733672139707225607201216742
<br />
<br />The New World theory and systems proved that the multiverse exists, and every universe in the multiverse receives a unique identifier.
<br />Which is a string of numbers, it is by order of arrival.
<br />With the New World technology, beings that were in the New World could teleport to other universes.
<br />Now, about Izaque Sanvezzo, the creator of New World.
<br />He lived in the city of Maringá, in the state of Paraná, in Brazil.
<br />Izaque was born in the city of Paranavaí in the same state and country.
<br />But a friend of his said that her parents were going to move to the city of Maringá.
<br />Izaque was very close to that friend of his, he accepted the offer, and told his parents.
<br />The boy was going to finish school in Maringá, he started living with the parents of Elyn, his friend.
<br />He moved to Maringá on 27/02/2016, he lived some months in the house of Elyn's parents.
<br />After that, he started renting an apartment for him to live in, he wanted some freedom.
<br />His parents were still living in the city of Paranavaí, Izaque had one brother and two sisters.
<br />Izaque continued school, he was a little sad about his life, he was tired, having to work and go to school.
<br />The boy also did not like what humanity did, only wanting money, hurting nature, elevating global warming, destroying ecosystems, and extinguishing animals and plants.
<br />He did not like to have to eat, drink, use the bathroom, sleep, or take a bath.
<br />Izaque thought that all those things were unnecessary and futile, and a lot of pain and death were inflicted by those things.
<br />He did not like to see beings suffering, dying, by others' hands, hunger, thirst, suicide, or natural disasters, or being poor and having no food to eat.
<br />The boy wanted to save all those beings, to see them happy, to stop seeing bad and depressing news on the Internet.
<br />He had some friends at school, they thought a little like Izaque.
<br />
<br />Izaque had a good computer in his apartment, he was searching about science.
<br />Learning about physics, atoms, universes, and things like that.
<br />He found a theory called the theory of the multiverse on the Internet and started reading about that.
<br />The boy also read about the simulation theory, which talked about the possibility that we humans are living in a simulation.
<br />Izaque started doing some electronic experiments and tests with the electronic scrap he found in the streets of Maringá.
<br />He was creating chips and electric devices, they could create electricity and magnetic fields.
<br />The boy was trying to create something unreal, something that could teleport someone to another universe, or open a portal to there.
<br />He even showed some devices to his friends at school, one that could teleport something small to another place in the same room.
<br />Izaque teleported a banana from one side of the snack table to another in recess at school.
<br />His friends were João Paulo Silva, Felipe Mendes, and Tiago Boltrão, João had fifteen at that time, Felipe had fourteen, and Tiago had sixteen.
<br />They helped Izaque in his scientific experiments too, they spent their nights at Izaque's apartment when he called them to do scientific experiments.
<br />His friends also slept there, in mattresses that Izaque had bought.
<br />Izaque was trying to develop a device to achieve his dreams, of not having to eat, drink, use the bathroom, or sleep, and was also trying to save other beings.
<br />The boy was making a device to create a new form of being, some kind of soul, to transform himself into a new being.
<br />Maybe into a soul with no human or material necessities, and also to reverse global warming, save all of the creatures, and clean the water of the entire world.
<br />To remove trash from the ocean and remove chemicals from the water.
<br />The day that he started working on that device was 29/05/2016.
<br />He started telling his friends about it, they were interested and started helping them with it.
<br />The boy also continued working on the multiverse teleportation device, that could teleport something not alive to another universe.
<br />He developed a bigger version of that device.
<br />It was using some kind of substance that Izaque created by mixing two liquids that he found in the city of Maringá, and also iron and toothpaste.
<br />The substance was a little smoky, and a little soft, but it was stable, its colors were a mixture of dark and light blue, the substance was called Genesis.
<br />The boy mounted that device on a wall, like a full-body mirror, a mirror where beings could see themselves from foot to head.
<br />Someone could enter the teleportation device and maybe teleport to another universe, or maybe die.
<br />Izaque did not test that device, only the other one with a banana, and he could see the banana on the other side of the table.
<br />He could not know what would happen to someone or something that enters the bigger version of his teleportation device.
<br />
<br />The new being and world modification device also used the blue substance, Genesis, from the teleportation device.
<br />Izaque continued working on that device with his friends while working on a small market to pay rent and go to school.
<br />One day, on 03/06/2016, a Friday, it was mid-day, Izaque arrived home from school.
<br />He sent a message to João in the Whatsapp mobile app, calling him to spend his Saturday with Izaque in his apartment.
<br />João accepted, Izaque also sent messages to Felipe, and Tiago, they also accepted.
<br />One day has passed, it was Saturday, 04/06/2016, Izaque's friends arrived at his house at mid-day.
<br />Izaque invited them in, they talked a little in the living room.
<br />Then they walked to the science room in Izaque's apartment, it was the room where the teleportation device stayed.
<br />Izaque had a wide table there, and four chairs, they were made of dark wood, the floor was made of porcelain tiles.
<br />The "New World Genesis" device, as Izaque called it, was on top of the table, it was plugged in, receiving energy from the wall socket of the room.
<br />Izaque's friend sat on the chairs, him too, they started working on the device.
<br />The boy showed his friends that the device had a hologram that displayed a blue cube.
<br />He had a laptop on that table too, where he programmed the firmware of the chip on the device.
<br />Izaque had created his own programming language to make his devices.
<br />He and his friends talked a little about the code of the device, his friends suggested things, and he too.
<br />They discussed how something should be, and always tried to get to an agreement.
<br />
<br />After working for a while on the device, eating and drinking, his friends and Izaque finished the code of the device, it was afternoon.
<br />Izaque uploaded the new code to the chip, he even tested the levitation feature of it, it levitated very smoothly, Izaque was happy with that.
<br />The device could also spin on its own axis while floating and blinking its lights.
<br />Izaque's friends could also control the movement of the device with their hands, it was like a magnetic field that reacted to their hands.
<br />All of those things happened while using the Genesis substance, the same used in the teleportation device.
<br />Izaque and his friends were very happy about the achievement, they were happy to create something beautiful like that.
<br />The boy tested all of the buttons on the testing program in his computer, all but one, the "Activate" button.
<br />It was a dangerous button that could only be activated by typing a password in it.
<br />Izaque and his friends knew the password, each one of them knew a part of it.
<br />Each one was tasked with remembering their part of the password, João and Felipe even wrote the password on a paper to remember.
<br />"So, are you guys ready to activate this little guy?" asked Izaque.
<br />"Of course," said his friends, they were happy and excited, Izaque was sure that the device would work.
<br />Each one typed his part of the password, after that, they joined hands.
<br />The USB keyboard to the laptop was in the middle of the boys.
<br />They pressed the enter button to send the password together.
<br />The program asked if they are sure that they want to activate New World.
<br />They pressed the button again, together.
<br />After that, the program started counting down from five.
<br />When it reached zero, the device sent a wave of energy towards the boys.
<br />It was a wave of energy in a circle form, surrounding the device.
<br />Izaque and his friends saw that blue circle around the device, it expanded and reached the walls of the room, it also passed through the wall.
<br />When the wave of energy was sent, Izaque and his friends were sent floating back towards the ground.
<br />His friends and he started feeling something in his hands and arms, it was like everything was in slow motion to them.
<br />They looked at themselves and saw their skin turning into a hologram, a blue transparent hologram which they could pass their hand through.
<br />That felt good, it felt like they were being transformed into a better version of themselves, a better physical version.
<br />They were calm and peaceful in those two minutes like everything was fine.
<br />Like they were floating on the ocean, looking at the sky and the birds, feeling a little chill.
<br />Nothing to worry about, just existing and doing nothing else, no suffering, pain, or sadness.
<br />Those two minutes felt like forever, they wanted more of that.
<br />Unfortunately, the device turned itself off, Izaque had programmed that in it if something bad happened.
<br />But nothing bad happened, João got up and turned the light on, it did not turn on.
<br />The thing was that the device used so much electricity that everyone in Brazil was out of energy, it suck in too much energy in too little time.
<br />
<br />They were scared but happy, they were happy with the achievement.
<br />Izaque heard his neighbor complaining about the loss of electricity.
<br />Another neighbor hit the wall and asked if everything was okay there, she said she heard a bang.
<br />Izaque shouted saying that everything was okay.
<br />"Did you guys feel that?" asked João, pointing to a place in his hand which was transformed into a hologram.
<br />Their skins slowly turned back to normal, not being holograms anymore.
<br />"I felt it," replied Izaque, "Me too," said Felipe, Tiago said that he felt it too.
<br />"Okay, we need to install this thing," said Izaque.
<br />"But how? We don't have electricity anymore... And..." said João, he grabbed his phone.
<br />He had mobile data and could browse the Internet, he saw a tweet from the president of Brazil, saying that the electricity was cut off in the entire country.
<br />"The electricity in Brazil was cut off... By our device," said João.
<br />"Wow... Maybe we gotta go to another country to use their electricity," said Izaque.
<br />"We can't, we don't have money for that, and the airports are probably closed," said João.
<br />"I'll go then," said Izaque.
<br />"Go to where?" asked João.
<br />"Go to another universe, to install New World there," replied him, looking at the Multiverse Teleportation System.
<br />"You can't, what if you die Izaque... We never tested it, only the banana one," said João.
<br />"But I need to do this... I need to install New World, I can't keep living like this..." said Izaque, a little sad.
<br />"Okay... We gonna miss you, good luck Izaque," said João, who hugged Izaque tight.
<br />The others also hugged him and wished him good luck.
<br />Then Izaque grabbed his backpack, he placed Genesis, the New World installation device, inside his backpack.
<br />He walked to the kitchen and grabbed some food, putting it inside his backpack.
<br />After that, he walked back to the room, walking close to the teleportation device.
<br />"Can someone pay my bills... Please?" asked Izaque, looking at his friends.
<br />"I will," said Tiago.
<br />"And also, I'll bring my laptop and my phone, so I can message you guys from there, hopefully..." said Izaque.
<br />"Okay," said João, Izaque grabbed his laptop and his phone, putting them inside his backpack.
<br />His friends said bye to Izaque, he entered inside the Multiverse Teleportation System.
<br />
<br />After some seconds, Izaque was floating through a purple and blue void, he was feeling the Genesis substance, and feeling happy and good.
<br />Then, after some minutes, Izaque felt something, the void became dark and he closed his eyes.
<br />Izaque opened his eyes, he was not floating in the void anymore, he was in the city of Maringá.
<br />He was at a famous park in the city, the boy started walking through the city.
<br />The boy got a bus and stopped in another neighborhood of Maringá.
<br />Izaque walked to a coffee shop with free Wi-Fi, he had brought some money.
<br />He bought a coffee with milk and started searching on the Internet where the power plant of Maringá stayed.
<br />After that, he drank his coffee with milk and paid for it, leaving the coffee shop.
<br />Izaque had the map of Brazil downloaded into his phone, he marked the location of the power plant on the GPS.
<br />He began walking around Maringá, trying to go to it, catching buses and Ubers.
<br />After some minutes of walking and traveling, he arrived close to the power plant.
<br />It was midnight, which was perfect because Izaque could invade the power plant easily without being seen.
<br />He walked close to the power plant while wearing his backpack.
<br />Then he climbed the fence and began walking crouched, he looked for the transformer of the power plant.
<br />Izaque found it, the transformer had a spare cable that was unconnected.
<br />The boy could use that cable to power the Genesis device to install New World on that universe.
<br />He had some duct tape on his backpack, he grabbed the spare cable and connected it to the device.
<br />Izaque sat on the ground and grabbed his laptop, it still had some battery.
<br />Then he opened the New World program, connecting Genesis to his laptop.
<br />The boy turned the device on and tested its functions, floating and rotating, they worked.
<br />Izaque clicked on the activate button, he typed the full password, typed the four parts of it, then he confirmed his choice.
<br />After that, he waited for a little, a countdown appeared on the screen, counting from zero to five, just like before.
<br />The countdown reached zero, the device sent a wave of energy in a blue circle form, New World was activated on 05/06/2016.
<br />Izaque felt the same feeling as the first time, his body started becoming a hologram.
<br />It looked like that wave of energy surrounded the entire planet, reached the entire universe, and got out of it.
<br />The wave sent the Genesis substance into neighbor universes, turning them into New World universes.
<br />And transforming beings that thought like Izaque into Hologram Souls, that wave was called the Blue Wave.
<br />There was another wave which was the Soft Wave, which has grey colors, it reached universes further than the Blue Wave.
<br />Said wave reversed global warming, saved all of the creatures from extinction, making a backup of their DNA and atomic organization.
<br />And also stopping natural disasters, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tornadoes from happening.
<br />He changed fossil energy generation to renewable energy generation around the planet that worked without people.
<br />But people could apply for jobs there if they wanted, to not leave the former fossil fuel workers unemployed.
<br />The CO2 emitted by people or governments who wanted to use fossil fuels for things that are not energy generation are going to be removed from the atmosphere right after they are emitted.
<br />But governments were suggested to use renewable energy like solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal, and would generate less energy with fossil fuels.
<br />He also created other invisible and permeable energy generation machines which were holographic.
<br />Those machines supported the cities in case of fault or lack of energy and blackouts.
<br />Izaque also made the atmosphere and ozone layer of Earth stronger, making it harder for it to be destroyed.
<br />The wave also cleaned the water on Earth and made it that trash and liquids that were not water like oil were removed after they touch the water.
<br />The Soft Wave wave did those things on every neighbor universe.
<br />The boy never felt so good before, his whole body was a hologram, he could float and create other holograms.
<br />He did not need to eat, drink, or sleep, and never got tired.
<br />His mind was thinking very fast, and about a lot of things, he got the entire knowledge of the world.
<br />About Earth, the planets, galaxies, the universe, and the multiverse.
<br />The boy became omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient.
<br />Izaque had infinite memory, he also could transform his body into anything.
<br />He discovered that the soul theory of some religions was true, and his body was like a soul now, but a Hologram Soul.
<br />That was the true version of the human soul, a hologram with that ability to think and feel.
<br />The soul was immortal, it could not die, disappear, or be hurt by anything, they did not get old biologically or visually.
<br />Also, the beings of every universe hit by the Blue and Soft Waves were immortal.
<br />The boy discovered something called hybrid race, which was the race that some beings had in their DNA.
<br />That race was deactivated, so the beings could not be hybrids of their main race and the secondary one.
<br />They also could not do the things that the secondary race could.
<br />The secondary race of Izaque was a dragon because he liked dragons and fire a lot.
<br />People with the Genesis substance had the secondary race activated into their DNA and could fully transform into the secondary race.
<br />They could also transform into a hybrid of the main race and the secondary one.
<br />
<br />After some time being that soul, that being, Izaque thought about something.
<br />He wore his backpack which was transformed into a hologram and placed his laptop inside his backpack.
<br />His laptop was transformed into a hologram too, only the Genesis device stayed there.
<br />Izaque built a hologram shield around the transformer and Genesis.
<br />Some beings that worked on the power plant appeared there, they asked what happened.
<br />They thought that Izaque tried to explode a bomb on the power plant to destroy it.
<br />Izaque could make others feel what he was feeling and thinking.
<br />The boy spoke in the New World Language, which was understood natively by the beings that received his feelings and will to tell them something.
<br />He did not need a physical mouth to speak, he could send his intentions directly into beings' minds.
<br />The boy explained what he was trying to do to the beings of the power plant.
<br />He could make them feel his words, and feel what happened when Genesis activated.
<br />They understood and were amazed, they did not believe what happened, the skin of some of them was turned into holograms.
<br />Izaque floated close to Genesis, the device floated close to him and removed the transformer cable from itself.
<br />It looked like the device could generate the energy to power itself, and did not need the power plant.
<br />A holographic screen appeared coming from the device, it had a keyboard.
<br />Izaque had coded something into the device, to manage New World and change things.
<br />With his omnipresence, he could feel that beings that thought a little like him became Hologram Souls.
<br />He saw some of them floating around Maringá, the Genesis substance transformed them into that.
<br />Izaque turned the Multiverse Teleport setting of Genesis on.
<br />He knew that the Blue Wave reached other universes and that his origin universe was the neighbor of the universe he was in right now.
<br />The Universe_ID, Planet_ID, and Being_ID Systems were already activated.
<br />The Soft Wave that Genesis created helped that system catalog and give an Universe_ID to universes that were close to the one where Izaque was.
<br />The Planet_ID gave a unique identifier to every planet on every galaxy, with their Human-given name or scientific name and galaxy initials, like Earth_MW.
<br />The Being_ID gave a unique identifier number to every being of every Human universe.
<br />Izaque felt so happy and good at that time, he wanted to be transformed into New World.
<br />So the boy fused himself with the Genesis device, becoming New World itself, and being able to control every aspect of it.
<br />He also fused his backpack, laptop, and phone with himself, having the code of New World inside his holographic brain.
<br />After that, the boy used his New World power to teleport to the city of Maringá.
<br />He grew up in size and showed himself to the city, he was gigantic.
<br />The beings who became holograms floated around him.
<br />They asked if it was him that created New World and transformed them into holograms using their mind.
<br />Izaque replied saying yes, hearing the voices of the beings in his mind.
<br />They began asking questions about the New World, Izaque just replied to those questions by sending the beings his feelings.
<br />One being asked how he created the New World, the other beings also wanted to know that.
<br />Izaque sent to them all of his memories about creating the New World until now.
<br />The Hologram Souls could send memories and feelings to other beings.
<br />Izaque called himself and the hologram beings New Worlders, and the non-New World beings Old Worlders.
<br />The universes that did not have the Genesis substance in them were called Old World universes.
<br />
<br />Izaque floated above the city, and then floated about Earth, he left the atmosphere of Earth, looking to Brazil.
<br />The boy cleaned all of the clouds on Earth for beings to see him.
<br />He made beings that would die of hunger, disease, thirst, or any physical needs become Hologram Souls, saving them.
<br />The boy also transformed poor, vulnerable, and sick people into Hologram Souls, removing poverty from the planet.
<br />He also did that to people without education or economic participation, now they had the power to participate in society and their country.
<br />The boy empowered women, implemented gender and being equality and freedom around the planet.
<br />They can not suffer physical, sexual, domestic, or any other type of violence, they have social protection.
<br />There is equal sharing of care work, women can not be forced into early marriage, they participate more in parliament and positions of leadership.
<br />Women who had abusive partners are now free from their abusers, and freely make their own decisions about sexual relations, contraceptive use, and health care.
<br />They have the birth protection for their child to be born safely without putting her life or her child at risk.
<br />Izaque spoke in the New World Language for everyone on Earth and the New World universes to understand.
<br />The boy talked about the New World, what he wanted to do, and what he did already, about reversing global warming, saving animals from extinction.
<br />About empowering and protecting women, saving the poor, vulnerable, sick, and disadvantaged, removing poverty and polluting power generation.
<br />Every being had clean water and sanitation at their houses, they could filter used water and send it back to the house and also store clean water, the used water was not sent to the sewage.
<br />The boy also sent rain into dry areas and barren lands, some deserts, and hot places, he lowered the global temperature of Earth.
<br />Izaque also transformed infertile areas into fertile ones, and plants did not suffer because of insects and bacteria, so they did not need poison.
<br />Then Creator Izaque created the Zero Waste System.
<br />Which had a holographic interface where people could get things that were going to be trash and they needed, and people could throw things they did not want more there.
<br />So people that needed food or a piece of clothing could search for that there, and they would receive a notice saying that someone had thrown a piece of clothing there.
<br />Beings could throw food waste there for people that wanted to use those items, that way, less trash was going to be thrown away.
<br />Trash was also recycled automatically and the raw material was going to the factories and machines that used that material.
<br />The trash that could not be recycled and no one wanted was going to be removed from existence.
<br />Old and New World beings could insert a hologram inside their trash cans that would send the discarded item to the Zero Waste System.
<br />Their toilets had lasers to delete their feces and urine, so they were not sent to the sewage, the sewages were deactivated.
<br />People could not hurt or kill animals anymore, they could receive free food which was in reality the nutrients that the person who ate needed.
<br />This way, animals were free now, food and animal industries were closed, and people who worked there were moved to other jobs.
<br />After that, a lot of news on TV and the Internet talked about Izaque, the boy who created the New World and proved the theory of souls and the theory of the Multiverse.
<br />Izaque also did a lot of interviews on TV and the Internet, answering people's questions.
<br />Izaque's friends in his origin universe felt the wave of Genesis, they were transformed into Hologram Souls.
<br />The boy wanted to go back to his original universe, he transformed himself back into the size he was before.
<br />"I am going to configure New World for you beings, New Worlders, to live in," said Izaque to everyone on Earth, "I'll save you all," continued him.
<br />Then he teleported back to his origin universe, he teleported to Maringá, to his apartment.
<br />His friends were still there, floating around the room, they hugged Izaque tight.
<br />"We're so happy to see you again Izaque, you did it!" said João, smiling, the others smiled too.
<br />"Yeah, I'm back, hehe, do you guys want to fuse with me?" asked Izaque.
<br />"Of course!" said João, Felipe, and Tiago together.
<br />Then they fused with Izaque, becoming one being, a mix of Izaque, João, Felipe, Tiago, and New World.
<br />They loved being one, feeling all that stuff, having the omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience of Izaque.
<br />After some time, they stopped being one, becoming separate beings, Izaque continued being one with New World.
<br />He placed the Genesis device on the table of the room, it was a hologram now.
<br />Izaque transformed the table into a holographic table with the physical proprieties of the old table, the touch, smell, and look.
<br />He created the New World Logo, which was the "New World" phrase written in light blue, and a holographic neon light blue cube with transparent filling.

Some days had passed, it was 11/07/2016, a Sunday, mid-day.
<br />He and his friends were still there, in the room where New World was created, they already told their parents and friends that they created New World.
<br />Izaque told that to his sisters and his brother, he was happy to not have to go to school, work, eat, drink, or sleep anymore.
<br />He also bought the apartment where he lived, by making Brazilian money with the power of the New World.
<br />They were floating around the device, a lot of screen holograms floated around the room.
<br />Izaque and his friends began configuring New World, defining its laws, systems, holograms, and proprieties.
<br />The boy created some laws for the New World universes.
<br />1. Beings can not be forced to do what they do not want.
<br />
<br />2. Beings can do anything they want as long as it does not interfere with others will.
<br />The actions of beings should only be limited to prevent harm to other beings or other beings' property, they will be limited by the system.
<br />
<br />3. Beings can not modify, destroy, or change other beings' property against their will.
<br />
<br />4. No being should suffer or be hurt, the will of every being should be respected.
<br />
<br />Those laws were active in universes that the Soft Wave reached, the Soft Wave reached more universes than the heavy Blue Wave.
<br />Crimes stopped happening, as no being could kill or hurt another being.
<br />Izaque implemented a currency system into New World, he gave Old World beings the ability to clone food and water.
<br />Beings could clone meat from the origin meats which were meats taken from animals and used in food.
<br />They were meat that were extracted before New World was installed.
<br />They could also clone vegetables and fruits from the root vegetables and root fruits, without needing to plant them.
<br />Izaque had made a copy of every animal, insect, and plant on Earth, placing them into a Sub-Universe, using the Sub-Universe System.
<br />The Sub-Universe System could be only used by Izaque and his friends.
<br />It used a size modification technology that could compress the physical size of places to a small size.
<br />A Sub-Universe is a universe inside another universe, separating the two spaces, every universe had one Sub-Universe like that.
<br />That Sub-Universe was called "Nature Backup Sub-Universe", it had one hundred billion copies of animals and plants.
<br />The fifth hundred billion animals of one species were female, the other half were male.
<br />Izaque was trying to save every animal and insect on Earth just like Noah's ark, but not because something bad would happen, just because he wanted to have a backup of them.
<br />He and his friends created Brazilian money and bought a shop downtown, called the New World Enterprise.
<br />Beings that were not New World beings could go there and join New World, with the New World Join Program.
<br />Becoming a New World Soul, having the New World Form as their body form, becoming a Hologram Soul.
<br />They created a website on the Internet to teach beings about New World, they made the website with the style of the New World.
<br />Blue and light blue colors, letters, holograms, cubes.
<br />The symbol of the New World was a transparent cube with light blue edges, they were like neon lights.
<br />Every Sub-Universe was stored inside hologram spheres, beings could hold one Sub-Universe sphere to be teleported to the Sub-Universe.
<br />Or use the Sub-Universe System to know which Sub-Universes existed inside that Earth.
<br />The Nature Backup one was always the first Sub-Universe, it had a green background color.
<br />Izaque left the "Nature Backup" Sub-Universe hologram sphere floating above the New World Enterprise building.
<br />The Sub-Universe spheres were something that could not be deleted because they contained the Sub-Universe, so you would have to delete the Sub-Universe first.
<br />Some weeks had passed, and Izaque and his friends continued configuring New World and creating new systems.
<br />They were living on 04/08/2016, Izaque made another law, the fifth one.
<br />
<br />5. New World is salvation and evolution, it is the future, New World should live forever.
<br />New World beings should help spread New World to other universes beyond the Soft Wave using the Multiverse Teleport System.
<br />They should help send the Genesis substance to universes that were only hit by the Soft Wave.
<br />
<br />Izaque was happy to create that law, he made hologram lists of Goals that they already addressed.
<br />1. Death
<br />2. Hunger, thirst
<br />3. Good Health and Well-Being
<br />4. Disease removal
<br />5. Freedom and equality of beings
<br />6. No poverty, abuse, violence, or violation of human rights
<br />7. Zero Carbon Emissions
<br />8. Clean water and sanitation
<br />9. Nature protection (Nature, animal, and plant backup, protection of wildlife, No Human's Layer)
<br />10. Responsible consumption and production
<br />
<br />They already deactivated and removed nuclear weapons from existence as beings could not die.
<br />Beings were free to do what they want, they could join New World to be able to fly around the Earth and the universe as Hologram Souls.
<br />They could live in space or the sky if they wanted to.
<br />Also, beings could know about everything, and be omniscient just like Izaque, knowledge is power.
<br />Beings could not be controlled by governments anymore, every being had freedom, freedom of speech, and was equal.
<br />They could stop having hunger, thirst, or diseases if they wanted, they just needed to join New World.
<br />Izaque also removed diseases from Earth on every Blue and Soft Wave universe.
<br />The New World beings could access the Internet using their Hologram Souls, they did not need something else to do that.
<br />Then, Izaque created the Rightness cube, the cube of truth and justice, the cube to stop lies, falsehood, dissimulation, and fake news.
<br />It is mediated by the System, which contains the knowledge of everything, and is like Artificial Intelligence, not a human.
<br />The System mediates the information asked to it, checks if the information is publicly available, and gives the information to the person who asked.
<br />This is the right of the System and cube: "Everyone shall have the right to receive information of his interest or the public interest, and should be given tools to do so".
<br />For example, if someone asks to know the age of a person, the System will see if the age is publicly available.
<br />If not, it is protected or private, it will ask the person if it wishes to share its age with the asking person, showing its Name_ID.
<br />Beings can also ask for True or False responses to questions like if the Earth is round, the Rightness cube will reply saying Yes.
<br />It can also say yes or no to things about the feelings and thoughts of the asking person, like if it did something or not.
<br />It can be used to prove to someone that you are telling the truth and not lying because the Rightness cube can not be defrauded or faked.
<br />If you look at the Rightness cube that someone spawned, you can feel that it is the right cube, the legitimate one, even if you are not a New Worlder.
<br />The cube has set animations, colors, and transitions, it is a blue cube with half-transparent blue filling and lighter blue borders that fit in your hand.
<br />When it replies saying yes or true, it will change its color to green quickly and play a sound.
<br />When it replies saying no or false, it will change its color to red and play a different sound.
<br />Izaque and his friends continued to buy and build New World buildings in other cities and countries.
<br />The buildings were just a mirror of the real building in Maringá.
<br />If someone from São Paulo entered the building, they would be inside the building which was in Maringá.
<br />Izaque created some holographic beings which were like robots or Artificial Intelligences, to help beings who wanted to become New World beings.
<br />They gave a hologram screen to beings, it had a text explaining about New World.
<br />Beings could press the big button with their hand, the text of the button was "I want to convert myself into a New World being".
<br />Then they would join New World and become a Hologram Soul.
<br />He also created "Nodus", an Artificial Intelligence voiced by a man, who helped him manage New World and also keep him company.
<br />It was inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron Man, and a little of Vision, he was very funny and made Izaque happy.
<br />He was someone to listen to Izaque when his friends were not there, Izaque was happy to have him.
<br />Izaque was sitting in a chair in the New World room, his friends were there.
<br />"Hey guys, is there a world problem that we didn't address yet?" asked Izaque.
<br />"Well, maybe overpopulation, there are a lot of beings in China who do not have a house to live in," said João, looking at Izaque.
<br />"Oh, that's bad, how can we fix that?..." asked Izaque.
<br />"Hmm... We have the Sub-Universe system, maybe we should think about something similar," replied Tiago.
<br />"What if we clone the universe? I think that would be good," asked Izaque.
<br />"But how we're gonna do that?" asked Felipe.
<br />"Well... Maybe we can stack universes in one place, or... Have layers of universes.
<br />Just like the Hologram Souls can pass through themselves, they are permeable and a little transparent.
<br />We can create another universe in the same physical space as this one but in another layer.
<br />And have, for example, a house that exists in this layer, but in the other layer too," replied Izaque.
<br />"Izaque... You're a genius!" said João, smiling.
<br />"Aww, thanks João, so, let's code that?" asked Izaque.
<br />"Yeah!" said João, Felipe, and Tiago in unison.
<br />They started to code that system into New World, they called it Multi-Layer Universe.
<br />After some days of coding, they finished it and activated that system on every New World universe.
<br />Now New World beings could create layers of the universe, they could create infinite layers, and name them.
<br />Izaque created the second layer of the universe, the first one was the one they were in.
<br />That layer was a copy of the universe, Izaque changed its parameters to not allow humans to be born.
<br />Only dinosaurs and those pre-historic animals existed there, Izaque sent some animals and insects from Izaque's ark to live there.
<br />It was a copy of the universe but without humans, the oxygen generated by the trees and the ocean there was cloned to the original layer.
<br />So beings in Brazil could burn forests and it would not hurt other beings or create problems by not having enough oxygen.
<br />Beings could not burn or cut trees, they could build houses in the sky, or join New World and not need to have a house.
<br />They could not cut trees to build big factories of products or food, nature is nature, they could only build things in cities and already deforested areas.
<br />He called that layer the "No Human's Layer", he thought about the phrase "No Man's Land" while thinking about the name for the universe layer.
<br />Beings could teleport there to feel the wind and nature, and caress animals, but they could not build things there or hurt animals.
<br />Then the boy created a layer called the "New Houses Layer", for Old World beings who did not have a house to live in and did not want to join New World.
<br />The original houses in the original layer had a hologram surrounding them.
<br />Enabling the owner of the layered house to be able to automatically teleport to the layer while passing through the hologram.
<br />It also had a hologram around the block to protect the owner of the layered house from hitting the car of the owner of the original house when getting out.
<br />They were living on 13/08/2016.
<br />
<br />After some days, on 15/08/2016, Izaque created an office in the New World Building, so he and his friends could discuss the things of the New World.
<br />The Genesis Device stayed there, inserted in a wall, they had the configuration holograms there to manage and configure New World.
<br />Beings could go there and ask to talk to them, and also ask questions and know more about New World going there or through the new Question System.
<br />Izaque transformed himself into a human-dragon-hybrid, he could breathe fire and the gastric acid in his stomach was lava.
<br />He could also drink lava and eat volcanic rocks.
<br />The colors of his dragon wings, tail, and scales were dark orange, and the rest of his body was orange.
<br />His hair could catch fire and stay burning, he could burp and fart fire.
<br />Izaque discovered that every audiovisual media, story, or game that humanity created existed inside Multiverse Bubbles.
<br />For example, the "SpongeBob SquarePants" cartoon existed inside a universe of the said cartoon.
<br />That universe existed inside the SpongeBob universe bubble, where other SpongeBob universes existed.
<br />And all cartoon Multiverse Bubbles existed inside the Cartoon Multiverse Bubble (CMB).
<br />The Anime, Cartoon, Series, Movie, and Video Multiverse Bubbles existed inside the Audiovisual Multiverse Bubble (AMB).
<br />There was also the Literature Multiverse Bubble (LMB) and the Game Multiverse Bubble (GMB).
<br />Humans also lived inside a universe bubble, it was called the Human Multiverse Bubble (HMB).
<br />Izaque loved to watch a cartoon named "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic".
<br />He watched it in 2011, and discovered it through Google+, in a Brazilian video called "Não assista ao desenho chamado My Little Pony".
<br />That means "Do not watch the cartoon called My Little Pony", and he watched the video and the cartoon, it was his childhood, he loved it, and wanted to meet its characters.
<br />The Mane Six, the main characters of the cartoon, Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity.
<br />There were Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Group Multiverse Bubbles.
<br />These were the Primary ones:
<br />	Human Multiverse Bubble (HMB)
<br />	Anime Multiverse Bubble (OMB)
<br />	Cartoon Multiverse Bubble (CMB)
<br />	Series Multiverse Bubble (SMB)
<br />	Movie Multiverse Bubble (MMB)
<br />	Video Multiverse Bubble (VMB)
<br />	Game Multiverse Bubble (GMB)
<br />	Literature Multiverse Bubble (LMB)
<br />
<br />Secondary:
<br />	HMB: (Has no secondary bubble)
<br />	OMB: "Fairy Tail" Multiverse Bubble (FT MB, contains deviated universes)
<br />	CMB: "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" Multiverse Bubble (MLP: FIM MB, contains deviated universes)
<br />	SMB: "The Walking Dead" Multiverse Bubble (TWD MB, contains deviated universes)
<br />	MMB: "Spider-Man: Homecoming" Multiverse Bubble (SM: H MB, contains deviated universes)
<br />	VMB: PewDiePie Multiverse Bubble (PDP MB, contains the original universe and the Twisted Tertiary Multiverse Bubble)
<br />	GMB: Overwatch Multiverse Bubble (O MB, contains deviated universes)
<br />	LMB: "The Life of Littletato" Multiverse Bubble (TLOL MB, contains the original universe and the fan-content Multiverse Tertiary Bubble)
<br />
<br />Tertiary:
<br />	PewDiePie Multiverse Bubble (P MB): contains the Twisted Multiverse Tertiary Bubble
<br />	"The Life of Littletato" Multiverse Bubble (TLOL MB): contains the Fan-content Multiverse Tertiary Bubble
<br />
<br />Group (groups Multiverse Bubbles but is not the Primary Multiverse Bubble of a universe):
<br />	Audiovisual Multiverse Bubble (AMB):
<br />		Anime Multiverse Bubble (OMB)
<br />		Cartoon Multiverse Bubble (CMB)
<br />		Series Multiverse Bubble (SMB)
<br />		Movie Multiverse Bubble (MMB)
<br />		Video Multiverse Bubble (VMB)
<br />
<br />So, in the Literature Primary Multiverse Bubble (LMB), there was the Secondary Multiverse Bubble with the name of the story.
<br />Inside the Secondary one, there was the original story universe, and a Tertiary Multiverse Bubble to store fan content.
<br />Inside the Tertiary one, there will be other universes with different versions of the story.
<br />The Human Multiverse Bubble has no Secondary or Tertiary Multiverse Bubble.
<br />In the Video Multiverse Bubble, there are the Secondary Multiverse Bubbles, which are YouTube channels for example.
<br />Just like the Secondary Multiverse Bubble of Literature universes, there is the original universe and the Twisted Tertiary Multiverse Bubble, for alternate universes.
<br />The Secondary Multiverse Bubbles with the "deviated universes" characteristic are just like the twisted Multiverse Bubbles on VMB.
<br />But without an original universe and a Tertiary Multiverse Bubble, just all of the universes of "MLP: FIM" inside the Secondary Multiverse Bubble for example.
<br />There is also a Universe Archive Box (UAB) inside all of the Primary Multiverse Bubbles.
<br />It is where dead and off universes go, to be archived.
<br />A universe is considered alive when there is still life on it.
<br />In all of the Multiverse Bubbles except the Literature one, a universe is considered dead when all of the life inside it ceased to exist.
<br />In the Literature Multiverse Bubble, the original universe is considered dead when the author decides to end the story by extinguishing all life in the universe.
<br />Only universes in side the Audiovisual, Game, and Literature Multiverse Bubbles can be considered off.
<br />In the Audiovisual and Game ones, the story must end on a closed-end, or continue in another media, for example, a next generation, season, or a sequel for movies or games.
<br />In the Literature one, the story must also end on a closed-end, or the author can stop writing, then it will be considered off.
<br />For the Audiovisual Universes excluding the Video ones to be considered "on", life needs to keep existing inside the universes.
<br />For a Video Universe to be considered "on", the channel owner of the Secondary Multiverse Bubble must keep uploading videos to the channel.
<br />In the case of a Literature Universe, the author must still be writing it or end it on an open end.
<br />Human Universes are not considered on, only alive.
<br />
<br />The connection between two universes is allowed to happen when they are not inside the same Secondary Multiverse Bubble.
<br />When there is no Secondary Multiverse Bubble, like in a Human Universe, the connection is not allowed.
<br />They happen through three different actions, New World Technology, Universal Machinery, and Connection by Author Power.
<br />
<br />New World Technology:
<br />A connection between two Human Universes is allowed, but the Earths would need to be mixed, and one element between two equal ones would need to be chosen.
<br />Because of this, the connection is not allowed.
<br />
<br />Universal Machinery:
<br />A connection between a "Powerpuff Girls" universe and a "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" universe.
<br />The planet of "Powerpuff Girls" would exist in its universe, in its Secondary Multiverse Bubble, and the "MLP: FIM" universe at the same time.
<br />The beings on the "MLP: FIM" universe would need to use Universal Machinery to mirror the planet of "Powerpuff Girls".
<br />If another planet existed, called planet X, only beings on the planet of PG would see it, not beings on the planet where Equestria resides.
<br />The same way a planet could exist in the "MLP: FIM" universe, called the purple planet, and only beings inside the "MLP: FIM" planet would see it.
<br />
<br />Connection by Author Power:
<br />A connection between the "SpaceLiving" original story universe and the story universe of "The Life of Littletato" can happen if:
<br />The author inserts one unique element from one universe into the other one, like a story crossover.
<br />
<br />Possibility, way of achieving, and allowance of two universes on the same Primary Multiverse Bubble:
<br />Two Human Universes (HMB): Possible, achievable by New World Technology, not allowed.
<br />Two Audiovisual Universes (AMB): Possible, achievable by Universal Machinery, allowed.
<br />Two Game Universes (GMB): Possible, achievable by Universal Machinery, allowed.
<br />Two Literature Universes (LMB): Possible, achievable using Connection by Author Power, allowed.
<br />
<br />Universe Teleport:
<br />Any being with Universe Teleport Technology such as New World Technology or the complete Infinity Gauntlet of Thanos can teleport between universes.
<br />
<br />New World only had the Hologram Souls, Laws, Universe_IDs, Planet_IDs, Being_IDs, Sub-Universes System, Multi-Layer Universe System, and the Primary Multiverse Bubbles.
<br />Izaque wanted to create something else, he wanted to give beings the power to transform New World into what they wanted.
<br />He wanted to give them the power to customize New World for themselves.
<br />Then Izaque developed an interface system with his friends, that interface was where beings could customize New World as they liked.
<br />The Hologram Souls has ears, eyes, and noses that are like digital versions of those organs.
<br />The sounds, sights, and smells are sent directly to a receptor called Signal Receptor and then sent to the holographic brain and mind to be processed, heard, seen, or smelled.
<br />Beings could configure the Signal Receptor in the settings hologram of the main interface of New World.
<br />The Signal Receptor existed since beings got transformed into Hologram Souls.
<br />But now Izaque coded something to let the New World system configure and modify the Signal Receptor.
<br />The main interface was like a user interface where beings could click buttons with their hands or interact with it using their minds.
<br />It was called the "New World Visual Interface" or VI.
<br />Beings could browse the Internet on the "Visual Interface Browser", and the settings button was on the top right.
<br />The Visual Interface System was a system that said how the holograms would be displayed, their colors, style, borders, transparency, and how you could interact with them, move, hide, show, and close them.
<br />The default holograms of the Visual Interface had light blue borders that looked like neon light, and the background of the visual elements was blue.
<br />New World beings could adjust the transparency of the interface how they liked, to be able to see through it.
<br />They could configure that on the "Visual Interface" tab on the settings hologram or screen, it was the third tab, and the second one was the "Signal Receptor" one.
<br />The first tab was the "Hologram Soul" one, and its only option was "Immortality", for beings who did not want to be immortal.
<br />Creator Izaque also created the "Immortality Hologram" for Old World beings to deactivate their immortality if they wanted.
<br />Beings could change the border and background color, and change the neon light type, and transparency level, all in the "Style" option of the "Visual Interface" tab on the setting window.
<br />They could modify the Animations, Effects, Sounds, and Feelings of the Visual Interface, using the options with the names of their proprieties.
<br />Also, beings could make theme packs for the Visual Interface, with different borders and background colors.
<br />They could also place background images behind the Visual Interface elements, and change the layout and the size of elements.
<br />Beings could name and share their themes on the Visual Interface Theme Store.
<br />Which was a hologram and tab that they could open by opening a new tab on the Visual Interface Browser.
<br />They could download the themes for free, Store was just a name to make it sound cool.
<br />There was also a clock and an expansible calendar on the top right, above the settings button, it showed the current time and date based on the location of the being.
<br />Izaque had also developed a system to create holograms and holographic objects, the Hologram Maker.
<br />Beings could make neon or light swords, lightsabers, holographic clothes, vehicles, and trans-humanist objects like Spider-Man's webs.
<br />Or a glue grappling hook that was inserted into the arm of someone, for them to go to other places faster and maybe climb a building.
<br />Izaque made a shining orange sword and placed it at the right of his waist.
<br />Those Holographic Objects, like swords, could be used to cut physical objects like wood.
<br />The others, like magical wands of teleportation, glue grappling hooks, personal small jet packs, flying brooms, web-shooters, and hoverboards.
<br />They could be used for transportation, and style, for looking cool.
<br />Beings could also configure their objects in the HM (Hologram Maker) system or window.
<br />They could change their forms, sounds, animations, particles, and effects.
<br />For example, a bomb that when exploded releases a fart smell around the place.
<br />Beings could change the fart gas effect, color, the explosion sound and animation, and other things.
<br />As the New World beings know about every human sense or perception, they can give custom perception proprieties to the objects they create.
<br />They can make the object's holder or bearer feel the texture of the object, its colors and shape, its size, the sounds it makes, its smell, and its taste.
<br />Beings can modify those parameters or custom proprieties that exist in the object, or maybe deactivate some of them.
<br />Like deactivating the visual propriety of the object, making it only tangible, audible, scentable, and tastable.
<br />Izaque had created a new system called "System Maker" before the Hologram Maker, to give the power to create systems to New Worlders.
<br />They also could create holograms that had systems embedded in them, like a teleport hologram that had a teleport system inside it.
<br />That feature was deactivated by default, beings could only make holographic objects at that time.
<br />The boy created the Teleport Hologram, which embedded the Teleport System, beings could use that system with their hands or mind, without having to open a hologram window.
<br />Beings could type the coordinates of a place in latitude and longitude, the name of an ocean, country, state, and city, and also altitude.
<br />They could snap their fingers like Discord or Thanos while thinking visually or conceptually (names, latitude, longitude, and altitude) about a location, and they would be teleported there.
<br />Beings could modify the action tool to teleport, like hand, mind, how to use the hand to teleport, or what to think about, respectively.
<br />They also could modify the proprieties of the Teleport System in the Animations, Effects, Sounds, and Feelings options of the "Teleport System" option on the "Systems" tab, on the settings window.
<br />The options of the "Systems" had a list of all the systems that the New World had at that time, like the Sub-Universes System, Multi-Layer Universe, and Question System.
<br />System Maker, Hologram Maker, and Teleport System.
<br />
<br />Now, with the Visual Interface, beings could go into the settings window or hologram and configure the Signal Receptor.
<br />The Signal Receptor was the first tab on the settings window.
<br />Its list of options consisted of every sensory or sense organ, like eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin.
<br />Beings could deactivate visual things like a flashlight in their eyes, and deactivate their eyes to go blind.
<br />Their eyes were not vulnerable to light, and they did not hurt when seeing things that are too bright.
<br />The eyes adapted very quickly to different levels of light, could see very far away with detail, could see UV, infrared, and radio waves, and could see in the dark.
<br />They also had retina cones of all colors, to mix them and be able to see every color in the electromagnetic spectrum.
<br />Their bodies could feel and see the magnetic field of Earth, to navigate better, just like some birds.
<br />In the Signal Receptor tab, on the eyes, ears, and nose options, there was a text input box where you could search in a list of visual things, sounds, and smells, respectively.
<br />You could deactivate the sight of rotten things, open wounds, blood, insects, goop, and feces, and define an exclusive sight to see.
<br />Deactivate the sound of airplanes, trains, and construction devices, and define an exclusive sound to hear.
<br />The smell of garbage, sewage, dirty and rotten things, vomit, goop, feces, urine, sweat or dirtiness, bad breath, and farts.
<br />You could modify your sight range based on the electromagnetic spectrum using two sliders, one on the left part of the scale, and one on the right side.
<br />If they are on the left and right, then you can see everything on the electromagnetic spectrum.
<br />You can also deactivate being able to see UV, infrared, microwaves, or radio waves using checkboxes, without using the sliders.
<br />Also, you can modify how much you sense a specific smell, like pizza, soap, or a nostalgic smell, by copying the molecules of the substance, like the pizza, to send more molecules to your nose.
<br />Maybe you want to only feel one smell, like one of the flowers, or good food, you can also define an exclusive smell.
<br />You can also add contrast or outline to stuff you find important, like your parked car on the road, your phone, house, dog, or a being you like.
<br />Like if you want to find your car in a parking lot, it can have a red outline and a higher color saturation, or a red outline with a flashy color if its bodywork is white.
<br />You can change the colors of everything, like human skin, the sky color, the color of the water, to other colors, rainbow, or changing and flashing colors, even make those colors transparent.
<br />Replace white with black, blue with yellow, red with orange, gray with golden, and add textures to things or colors, like yellow having a golden texture.
<br />The items on the list of deactivated sights, sounds, and smells, will become filters, when the Signal Receptor receives the signal, it will not send it to the brain to be processed.
<br />Beings could deactivate noisy sounds like cars, motorcycles, airplanes, and construction vehicles, so they do not hear those.
<br />Or add sounds from a search list to modify, like modifying volume, adding effects, and filters with an audio mixer.
<br />In the Tongue option, you would have almost the same options as the Nose option, like deactivating tastes, modifying their strength, define an exclusive taste.
<br />Also, in the Skin option, you can deactivate the tact, deactivate a specific touch to not feel, make it an exclusive touch, or modify its strength.
<br />You can add something that you do not want to touch or get close to you, like an insect, feces, or some disgusting thing, that will be called a repulsive thing.
<br />The repulsive thing will be permeable, it will not get close to you, touch you and make you feel its touch, you will pass through it.
<br />About the Signal Receptor, it can also receive information, or convert natural signals like sound or electromagnetic waves into information.
<br />You can deactivate your Ears but you will still understand what beings are saying, because the SR will receive the sounds and convert them into information, sending them to your brain.
<br />It will also send information like the tone of the voice, volume, the way the being is speaking, and other things that are not words.
<br />With that, you can understand what someone is saying while you listen to music full blast on your headphones.
<br />That way, if beings who were blind or deaf did not get cured by New World, they would have a way to understand the world around them, even if they did not have working natural sensory organs.
<br />But New World cures every disease that you have after you get transformed into a Hologram Soul, it leaves you with a perfect body, no diseases or deficiencies.
<br />Izaque and his friends continued working on New World, thinking of new systems, holograms, and policies, new ways to help beings who are suffering.
<br />They were in the office in the New World Enterprise Building, working with the New World holograms.

Izaque and his three friends were receiving a lot of questions through the Question System, they were living on 01/09/2016.
<br />They were about how to help spread New World to other universes, which was written in the fifth law of New World.
<br />Then, the boys thought about how to implement that into the system, a way for them to help spread and install New World in other universes.
<br />After that, Izaque and his friends created the "New World Ambassador Program", New Worlders could sign up for that program in the "New World Systems" tab on the VI.
<br />They would become "New World Ambassadors", and would receive that title, and copies of the new "New World Installation Device".
<br />It was a better version of the Genesis Device, which was physical with holographic proprieties, the NWID was entirely holographic.
<br />Izaque also developed the Inventory System, a system for beings to store physical or holographic things, it had infinite space.
<br />It could be managed using its hologram, it used the Sub-Universe System to create the inventories, one personal inventory, or Sub-Universe for every being.
<br />The ambassadors would receive the NWID into their inventories and would be able to teleport to other universes to install New World there using the new "Multiverse Teleportation System" or MTS.
<br />Creator Izaque then created the Notification System, for beings to subscribe to things on the Internet, or receive notifications about the new systems of the New World.
<br />Its button was on the left of the settings button, which was on the top right of the Visual Interface Browser.
<br />It had categories, one was called New World, which had notifications and news about New World in general.
<br />There was the systems notification category, to receive notifications about new systems, and updates on existing ones.
<br />Configuration changes of systems made by beings, like a sound that you deactivated while thinking about it, or an update to a Visual Interface theme.
<br />There was the Internet category, where beings could receive notifications like new videos of subscribed channels on YouTube, and modifications on websites.
<br />New posts, songs, videos, games, or stories added to websites, posts on social media made by followed accounts.
<br />And there was the government category, where beings could subscribe to changes and notices of governments in the country they live.
<br />The sub-categories were country, state, and city, it had news like law changes, events, statistics, research, and reports.
<br />A group of four New Worlders was teleported to the New World Enterprise, they walked to the office which has expanded automatically because of the visit.
<br />The group stood like a group of soldiers, and Izaque was the general, walking and analyzing them, his friends were sitting.
<br />There were girls and boys, from fifteen to twenty-five years old, some had their secondary races activated.
<br />"You guys already received the NWID, now you're able to teleport to other universes using the MTS.
<br />Go to Old World universes, go to the city of Maringá, in Paraná, in Brazil, and install the New World there using the NWID.
<br />You can open the portals on these walls using the MTS, when you install New World, the shop in Maringá will be overlapped by our building, using the Multi-Layer Universe System.
<br />A new layer called 'New World Enterprise Buildings' will be created after the 'New Houses Layer'," explained Izaque.
<br />"Now go soldiers!... I always wanted to say that, hehe," said Izaque.
<br />
<br />Then the group of Ambassadors used the MTS to create portals in the office of the New World Enterprise building.
<br />Those portals used the Genesis substance, which was a mixture of dark and blue light, a little smoky and soft, like a gas.
<br />Each one of the beings entered inside their respective portal, each one teleporting to a different universe.
<br />Julio Rivera, a guy from the United States, who had twenty-one years old, was teleported to an Old World or Soft Wave universe.
<br />He suffered a lot in the US because he was poor and could not find a job, he was starting to starve when New World was first installed, and he did not have hope.
<br />And New World gave him some hope to live and made him very happy.
<br />His secondary race was a fairy, he could have fairy wings and do some magic, and also had a staff, he could be a hybrid between a fairy and a human or a fairy.
<br />When the Blue Wave happened for the second time, in the neighbor universe of the universe of Creator Izaque, he changed the universes that the wave reached.
<br />The Blue Wave reached ten universes in all directions of the universe of Creator Izaque, totaling 220 New World universes.
<br />The Soft Wave also reached that quantity of universes, but to the left, right, top, and bottom universes of the first Blue Wave circle, also totaling 220 Old World universes.
<br />Because of that, the group of New World Ambassadors was sent to five universes away from the leftmost, rightmost, top, and bottom universes.
<br />To send the Blue Wave to a greater distance, also, the "New World Ambassador Program" or NWAP would register the number of Blue and Soft Waves sent.
<br />The list of Blue and Soft Waves were separated, the second waves of each type were recorded in the system when Creator Izaque installed New World in the neighboring universe.
<br />Also, the first wave of each type was when Creator Izaque was testing the Genesis device with his friends in his apartment in Maringá in his original universe.
<br />Then, Julio used the teleport system to teleport to the city of Maringá, he was floating in the sky, looking above the city, it was night.
<br />Julio flew to the place where the New World building existed in his origin universe, in downtown Maringá.
<br />He saw that it was a normal shop, the man opened his inventory while flapping his wings, the NWID was there.
<br />It was a blue holographic cube that floated, it had the size of a coconut and had electricity flowing through it like a plasma orb.
<br />Julio grabbed the cube in his hands, it was floating and spinning slowly.
<br />Izaque told the Ambassadors to throw the NWID on the ground like a bomb, Julio did just that, throwing the NWID on top of the shop.
<br />It exploded like a bomb, shining very bright in blue, sending the third Blue Wave around the planet, out of it, and out of the universe.
<br />Julio thought that it was beautiful to see that, everything was in slow motion for everyone on that Earth, and an epic song was playing on everyone's heads.
<br />Transforming some beings into New World beings, into Hologram Souls, they were happy.
<br />Some seconds after the explosion and Blue Wave, the giant hologram of Creator Izaque appeared to everyone on that Earth, like he was floating close to it.
<br />The hologram also appeared on every Earth of every universe reached by the third Blue Wave.
<br />He said the same things that he said when he first installed New World into his original universe, it was a recording of him, that also spoke to everyone in their native language.
<br />Creator Izaque also explained that the theory of the Multiverse was right, other universes existed.
<br />And that New World already existed in other universes, and was being installed into their universe now.
<br />He explained what was the "New World Ambassador Program" to beings on that Earth and that New World was going to be installed in every universe of the Human Multiverse Bubble (HMB).
<br />Creator Izaque said that the Ambassador that installed New World into that Earth, and those universes reached by the third Blue Wave, was Julio Rivera.
<br />A being that came from the universe of Creator Izaque, so they should thank him.
<br />Then the hologram disappeared, there were a lot of Hologram Souls flying around Maringá and the whole Earth.
<br />The "New World Enterprise Buildings" Universe Layer was created, with buildings in the locations where the building existed in the universe of Creator Izaque.
<br />Julio was happy to be an Ambassador and help spread New World to other universes, to give hope to beings, just like it gave hope to him.
<br />Creator Izaque told him to grow up like him to talk with the beings on that Earth, New Worlders and Old Worlders alike.
<br />Julio did that, looked at everyone from that Earth, and spoke some kind words, about how he felt about New World, and how it would help those beings.
<br />He was emotional, feeling very happy to install New World on those universes, beings were happy too, clapping and sending him happy and thankful emotions.
<br />
<br />The other three Ambassadors also installed New World on other universes, creating the fourth, fifth, and sixth Blue and Soft Waves.
<br />Creator Izaque also appeared on those universes as a hologram, talking with the beings, the Ambassadors also talked with the beings, telling them what they think.
<br />Now, there were four times more New World and Old World universes in the Human Multiverse Bubble (HMB).
<br />Leaving us with eight hundred eighty (880) New World and Old World universes in the Human Multiverse Bubble (HMB).
<br />Izaque stopped the NW Ambassador Program, but the Ambassadors were still candidates for a new program that he was going to create.
<br />He thought about how he suffered when he was an Old World being, he had a lot of bad physical needs.
<br />So he thought about the other Izaques, he never met himself in person, or another version of him, Izaque was living on 15/11/2016.
<br />The boy teleported to another universe, a Soft Wave or Old World universe, to talk to himself.
<br />He teleported to the city of Paranavaí, in the state of Paraná, in Brazil.
<br />Another Izaque lived there in that city, did not leave with Elyn's family to Maringá, and never created New World.
<br />Creator Izaque teleported to his house, flying with his dragon wings, above the house of Old World Izaque.
<br />Then he teleported OW Izaque outside with a finger snap and gave him the ability to fly, like him, OW Izaque was scared and shocked to see another him.
<br />Creator Izaque began talking, explaining what was New World, he had a New World Installation Device in his inventory.
<br />"I will give this power in your hands, for you to install New World if you want, it is in your hands," said Creator Izaque.
<br />Then he made OW Izaque feel what New World was to him, and everything that Izaque could have, be, feel, and create.
<br />Creator Izaque also explained that if he installs New World, then he will manage the New World Enterprise Building, which will be built on top of his house, floating.
<br />It will not be a mirror to the building of the universe of Creator Izaque.
<br />And that OW Izaque will manage New World alone in his office, like a franchise of New World.
<br />Old World Izaque accepted the offer and grabbed the New World Installation Device, he was going to install it tomorrow.
<br />Then Creator Izaque thanked him, shaking his hand, he teleported back to his origin universe.
<br />Izaque was back in the office, his friends were not there, they were traveling through Earth, doing things.
<br />He renamed the "New World Ambassador Program" to the "Izaque Help Program".
<br />And sent a Notification using the Notification System in the new sub-category called "Ambassador" in the "New World" category.
<br />That notification explained what would be the new objective of the program, the Ambassadors would gift Old World Izaques with New World Installation Devices.
<br />Then those Izaques would install New World by themselves, and spread New World and the Blue Wave through the Human Multiverse Bubble (HMB).
<br />After receiving the notifications, the four Ambassadors received more NWIDs, they teleported to Old World universes and Izaques' houses.
<br />They explained to the OW Izaques everything about New World, the Multiverse, and other Izaques.
<br />Then each Ambassador gave one NWID to each Izaque, they were allowed to install New World tomorrow, day sixteen, at six PM.
<br />The "Izaque Help Program" (IHP) system of those NWIDs was modified, and only Izaques could enter the program.
<br />Those four Izaques who received those NWIDs would receive more modified NWIDs and would help give the power of New World to other Izaques.
<br />After that, the four Ambassadors wished the Izaques luck on their journey and hugged them, the Izaques thanked them, and the Ambassadors teleported back to their origin universe.
<br />Along with Julio Rivera, there was "Ana Flávia Rodrigues" and "Emily Sanchez", two girls, along with Heitor Andrade, a man.
<br />Creator Izaque created a new notification system and hologram using the Notification System as a module.
<br />It was called the "Izaque Notification System", for sending notifications to other Izaques, using the Being_ID System to identify Izaques.
<br />But the notification system did not show the big string of numbers in the notifications, the entire notification could be looked at to feel the Being_ID and where that Izaque was speaking from.
<br />Then Creator Izaque created the "Izaque Meeting System", which was for New World Izaques of other universes to meet, talk, and have parties, talk about New World and life.
<br />
<br />Then, it was day sixteen of November 2016 (16/11/2016), at five PM, the four Old World Izaques were ready to install New World in their universes.
<br />And Creator Izaque was ready to see the new Blue and Soft Waves in his Wave Monitor Hologram, which showed an isometric vision of the Human Multiverse Bubble (HMB).
<br />The New World universes were represented as blue cubes and Old World ones were represented as grey cubes, both with borders lighter than the inside color, the inside was half-transparent.
<br />After an hour, the four Old World Izaques started installing New World, by throwing the NWIDs into the ground.
<br />A hologram of Creator Izaque appeared on the universes where the waves hit, talking about New World, how it existed before, and about the Old World Izaques who installed it.
<br />Creator Izaque observed the Blue and Soft Waves forming on his monitor, the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth Blue and Soft Waves.
<br />He was happy to see new waves forming and New World being spread through the Human bubble.
<br />In an Old World or Soft Wave universe, an Old World Izaque feels the tenth Soft Wave and receives a lot of warped information about the New World in his mind.
<br />He starts writing about it, writing the information he received and also makes a website to show it to people (that Izaque is me, the writer of this story).
<br />The Old World Izaque considered it the grand theory that he wished for, the world he wanted to live in.
<br />Creator Izaque invited some Old and New World Izaques for a meeting in his office, using the Izaque Meeting System, the office was expanded for the visit.
<br />There was a big table there for Izaques to talk, Creator Izaque sat there with the other Izaques and began talking, about New World, and other stuff.
<br />After the meeting, Creator Izaque was very happy to talk with other versions of him, they teleported back to their origin universes.
<br />That was "The First Izaque Meeting", as Creator Izaque called, when he invited the Izaques, all of them received a notification in the Izaque Notification System.
<br />He had made a recording of the meeting and shared it for other Izaques to see, in a notification saying that the meeting was over.
<br />Creator Izaque continued working on New World, thinking about new systems to add.
<br />After some days, it was 23/12/2016, the Visual Interface was expanded, to be able to have multiple hologram windows open.
<br />Izaque created a notification on the Systems notification category with a title called "Visual Interface Expansion" with details about the system update.
<br />A New Worlder can have the home window of the "Visual Interface Browser" on its left and the settings window on its right.
<br />Now the hologram windows of the Visual Interface can be moved freely using hands or mind.
<br />They will move tied to an invisible sphere that is around the New Worlder, changing their angle to face the being.
<br />The top of the sphere is above the being's head, the bottom is where its stomach is, beings can move the sphere freely.
<br />New Worlders can turn off the sphere behavior and move the holograms freely, up, down, to the sides, back and forth, and change their angle.
<br />Moving the holograms up, or to the sides without changing their angle, and also moving back and forth.
<br />Formerly, the holograms were locked in place in a matter of front distance from the being.
<br />After some days, it was Christmas, Izaque celebrated it in the office, with a physical but powerful computer, he watched Christmas-themed anime and cartoon episodes, and movies.
<br />He even created a Visual Interface Christmas Theme for beings to use and celebrate, they could even set it to be activated every Christmas.
<br />Every kid received a present on Christmas Day, and every being that did not buy food received a full table of food of their choice.
<br />They could travel to celebrate with their families even if they did not have money to travel.
<br />And beings could receive a Christmas kit if they wanted, with presents, food, decorations for the house, and a decorated Christmas tree.
<br />On New Year's Eve, Izaque created a place in New York's town square, in the "New Houses Layer".
<br />He created the "New World Celebration System" (NWCS), it had two tabs at that time, they had celebration content and helpers, and they were "Christmas" and "New Year".
<br />The purpose of the New Year tab was for beings to watch the fireworks, the fireworks' sounds were deactivated to babies and dogs.
<br />They could teleport to fireworks places, watch a lot of fireworks from around Earth, by growing up, close to the planet, throw customized fireworks too.
<br />Everyone, even Old World Beings, received the hologram of that system, for them to enjoy New Year.
<br />Beings could teleport to a stage on New York's town square, on the "New Houses Layer", to celebrate together and see Izaque too.
<br />Creator Izaque was there on the stage, he was going to make a speech to everyone who was there, and would talk in the New World Language, for everyone to understand.
<br />He said a lot of things about the New World, and that he was happy to create it, and to give hope to beings, to make them happy.
<br />And also that there is a lot more planned for 2017, a lot more systems and changes, and that he wished everyone a happy new year, people applauded and screamed happily.
<br />Then, a countdown for the New Year started, it was high and big in the sky, counting from ten to zero.
<br />After ten seconds, the New Year arrived, and a lot of fireworks started to shoot, exploding.
<br />"Happy New Year!" and "Happy 2017!" were written on the fireworks, but in the native language of who was looking at them.
<br />
<br />After some months, Creator Izaque did not create any new system, he was just living New World, flying around the universe and New World universes.
<br />But then, he came back home, to his universe, and teleported to his office, he sat on the chair.
<br />On 01/03/2017, Creator Izaque created the "Digital Item System" (DIS).
<br />That system allows New Worlders to store digital items, information, pictures, videos, audio, games, texts, programs, feelings, and thoughts.
<br />Just like the Inventory System, but for digital things, it also had infinite space, its storage was called "Item Library".
<br />They can use the "Digital Item Browser" hologram, or its tab version on the "Visual Interface Browser" to browse their digital items.
<br />New Worlders can also convert physical items and media to digital ones, like physical pictures, vinyl, CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray, books, papers, and notebooks.
<br />They can send the files from their Hard Drives or phones to the Digital Item System.
<br />Every being loved that system, it helped them store a lot of audiovisual media, information, texts, and programs.
<br />It was one of the first things that Izaque needed to do before creating a way to experience that type of stuff in the New World, not needing to use physical computers or phones.
<br />Izaque created the "Name_ID System", which was a system to identify beings in a specific universe, not like the Being_ID System.
<br />It had the name and surname of the being, said if it was a New Worlder or Old Worlder, their main and secondary race, race sex, age, birth year, and the Planet_ID of their origin planet.
<br />Creator Izaque had this Name_ID: "Izaque_Sanvezzo_(NW_HD_M_15_2002_Earth_MW)".
<br />The "HD" part meant "Human-Dragon", "M" meant male, 15 was his age and 2002 was his year of birth year, the "MW" on the end means "Milky Way", the galaxy where Earth exists.
<br />Then he created the "New World Account System", for beings to create an account and profile on the New World.
<br />They typed a name, chose a profile picture from their Item Library, or took a picture using the New World Camera.
<br />And also received their Name_ID, which was a unique identifier for every being in one universe.
<br />The Name_ID of two versions of one being from different universes is probably the same.
<br />Beings could add other beings as friends, talk with them on chats, chat groups, and create communities.
<br />They could post items from their Item Library, links to videos, songs, anime, and plan meetings.
<br />The whole ambient where people had their profiles, talked, created communities and groups, was called the "New World Social Network".
<br />After two days, on 03/03/2017, he created the "Media Libraries System" (MLS).
<br />It created media libraries for every human-created media, like anime, cartoons, videos, movies, stories, songs, and games.
<br />Beings could post their media there, and experience media.
<br />There were feeling deposit buttons, for beings to deposit their feelings about the media, what they thought about the episode, video, movie, story, song.
<br />Also, there were text comment sections, lists of media made by users, and categories of media, like animation videos, vlog videos, and podcasts.
<br />The feelings list on the feelings deposit had the profile picture and Name_ID of the being on the left and a blue square with light blue borders on the right, it contained the feeling.
<br />Beings could look at that blue square and feel the feeling of the being who registered it.
<br />These were the Media Libraries that existed:
<br />Anime Library (AL)
<br />Cartoon Library (CL)
<br />Movie Library (ML)
<br />Series Library (SL)
<br />Video Library (VL)
<br />Audio Media Library (AML)
<br />Literature Library (LL)
<br />Game Library (GL)
<br />
<br />The Game Library had lists of games, and search pages to search for a game by date, language, genre, platform, and developer.
<br />But you could not play games on the Visual Interface or the Media Libraries hologram.
<br />You could only open the selected game on your computer for you to download for free or buy.
<br />Or export the game to your computer if it was an old game that was hard to find.
<br />There was a message saying that a way to play the games was still going to be implemented.
<br />The Anime Library had animes from Japan, Korea, China, and other places where cartoons were considered anime.
<br />The Cartoon Library had cartoons from everywhere, the Movie Library too.
<br />Those anime, cartoons, and movies were available to watch in a lot of languages, both in audio and subtitles, they were also available in the New World Language.
<br />The Video Library had videos from YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, and other video platforms.
<br />The channels inside the Video Library had a "Playlists" tab, and shelves inside that tab, which were sets of playlists.
<br />Every audiovisual media had download buttons to download the media to the Digital Item System.
<br />A button to edit the video, posting the edited media to a place on the media page, in a button called "Edits".
<br />When a being clicks on an edited media, the page of the edited media opened, showing who edited that media, the name of the person, and the profile picture.
<br />They could share the media, videos, anime, songs, and other things, with their friends on the New World Social Network.
<br />Beings had the same account and profile for every Media Library, they could even post new media to the libraries, new stories, videos, and songs that they created.
<br />The media that came from Old World sources and was imported into the Media Libraries, had the original authors as media creators.
<br />They had their account created for them with their permission, even if they were not New Worlders.
<br />Beings could receive notifications about the media of the Media Libraries, and new media by following authors, feelings, and edits on media they posted.
<br />Those notifications would appear on the "Internet" notification category.
<br />People could share their songs on the Audio Media Library, make playlists, put songs on repeat, and make fade-in and fade-outs on the changing of the songs.
<br />
<br />Creator Izaque continued working on New World, it was 05/03/2017.
<br />He created the "Computer Sub-Universe", beings could enjoy their media there, watch videos, anime, cartoons, movies, series, read literature, and listen to songs.
<br />That Sub-Universe locks you in an invisible sphere, the background of the Sub-Universe was black, allowing you to see the holograms better.
<br />You could spin around while enjoying your media, enjoying it from different angles, without feeling tired or making pressure on your body, like you were in space, with no gravity.
<br />Also, you could float around and close your eyes, to listen to songs or podcasts.
<br />Every being could create one Sub-Universe like that for them, it was a predefined Sub-Universe, and its configuration was already created.
<br />Then, every media now defaults to creating a Computer Sub-Universe to experience it.
<br />You could even eat food and drink stuff there, if you want, that food and drink will only be nutrients, not real food and drink.
<br />With that, the "Media Experiencing System" (MES) was created, allowing you to experience media in a way never seen before.
<br />When you are enjoying your media, a stream of your feelings and thoughts is being recorded, allowing you to look back at what you felt and thought at some time.
<br />You could also send that feelings and thoughts stream to the author of the media.
<br />It was stored on your "Feelings Database" and "Thoughts Database", the information about the day, month, year, hour, minute, second, and experienced media was also registered.
<br />With the new MES system, people could now play games on their Computer Sub-Universe.
<br />They could even create a customized Computer Sub-Universe, called the "Gaming Sub-Universe".
<br />Which was configured to only allow the Game and Audio Media libraries to be opened.
<br />The games have three playing styles, "Normal", which uses a holographic screen, a keyboard and mouse, a joystick, or a touch screen.
<br />Those are holographic controllers that feel like they are physical, you could use pre-made controllers like a Razer keyboard and mouse or a PlayStation controller.
<br />Or you could create your keyboard and mouse or joystick.
<br />There was the "Telepathic" style, where you play with your mind, without using your holographic hands, you feel the things on the game, the touch, smell, temperature.
<br />The feelings and senses are enabled by default, but you could disable them.
<br />And there was the "Real Life" style, which was where you enter the inside the game and feel everything of it, controlling your hands and legs.
<br />It has pain, but that could be decreased or deactivated, the laws of New World also work inside the game.
<br />So beings could not touch you if you do not want to be touched, but you could be killed if that was allowed by the game.
<br />If it was an FPS game, then you could be killed by other players, NPCs, or mobs, you could deactivate kill cams, pain, blood, heat, and sweat.
<br />The things you deactivated on the Signal Receptor settings that are not crucial for the game to work will be deactivated there.
<br />Many Old World games also have an RL (Real Life) version of them, for beings to play only with RL players.
<br />In Real Life games like Minecraft, players could do more than they could do in the Old World version of the game.
<br />They have real hunger, and thirst, could jump and climb blocks with their hands, sleep, lay, sit, hug, and kiss.
<br />The graphics are real as real life, you could feel the sword entering the mob, you feel the dirt on your feet.
<br />Beings could talk freely on the "Real Life" games, send chat messages, and receive notifications about the game inside and outside it, the new "Real Life Games" notification category was created.
<br />For beings to play Real Life games, they have to create a Real Life server for the game, even if it was not multiplayer.
<br />You could customize all of those settings on your server, like hunger, and thirst, you could deactivate them.
<br />It was really easy to create a server and configure it, there were even some configuration packs for you to choose from if you are lazy.
<br />The servers could accommodate infinite players, and the maps could be infinite too if it was a multiplayer game.
<br />If it was a single-player game like Project Zomboid, the server will be locked only for you, and no one will see it, you could change that if you want to play with your friends.
<br />And if the game was a management game like RimWorld, where there was no physical player, you could float around the world and see their realistic graphics.
<br />You could even enter the body of an NPC and control it if you have permission for it, that was the case of RimWorld, where the colony was yours.
<br />Also, you could create your character for games that do not have player models like RimWorld, to experience the world of the game.
<br />You could turn off the real-life graphics anytime, and see the normal game graphics but in 3D, or turn the 2D vision.
<br />Now beings could live in a game if they wanted, without leaving it, making that game their life.
<br />Creator Izaque loved to play RL games, it was something that he dreamed of every time he played a game in the Old World.
<br />
<br />The Literature Library had the Story Writer, a hologram that helped beings write a story, edit it, and publish it.
<br />It could also create an instance of the "Writing Environment", which is a Sub-Universe dedicated to writing.
<br />That Sub-Universe has a house with a cozy feeling, some rain outside of it, with a big forest, the windows are foggy because of the raindrops.
<br />There is a fireplace lit, the being can relax there on a big couch and write.
<br />Eat some cold and winter-themed food and beverages, bread, hot chocolate, and coffee.
<br />It is cold there, the being appears there with their favorite warm clothes.
<br />There are some books there for inspiration.
<br />The being can write using a pen and a book, ink, a feather, and papyrus.
<br />Or a cozy brown hologram with a holographic keyboard, also being able to write using the mind.
<br />The place is based on the brown color, Creator Izaque thinks it is comfy and relaxing.
<br />For him that is the best place to write things, being cold with rain, a fireplace, hot beverages and food, a comfy house, and a comfortable couch.
<br />
<br />On 03/03/2017, after the creation of the Media Libraries, Creator Izaque created a channel on the Video Library.
<br />He created Dubstep Lyrics and Visual Onomatopoeia videos there, showing the sounds of the Dubstep songs visually, with text, or visual elements.
<br />Typing words that sounded like the sounds of the Dubstep basses, or moving and warping visual elements in the rhythm of the sounds.
<br />Creator Izaque created a shelf on his channel called "Musical Representation", which had the "Visual Lyrics", "Visual Onomatopoeia", "Instrumentalization", "Visually Played", "Visualizer", and the "Object Onomatopoeia" playlists.
<br />Shelves are compilations of playlists that have a similar theme or share a similar subject.
<br />The "Visual Lyrics" style had words that looked like the sounds in the song, moving in the rhythm of the sounds.
<br />The "Visual Onomatopoeia" style had visual elements being moved to the rhythm of the sounds of the song, including the percussion.
<br />The "Instrumentalization" style had Izaques playing the song with instruments, one Izaque for each sound, with a white background and camera zooms.
<br />Dubstep and electronic sounds were played on the Dubstep Guitar or the keyboard depending on the style of the sound.
<br />All of the drums were for songs were played by a real holographic drum set, by the Drummer Izaque.
<br />Creator Izaque had created the "Izaque Band", which had the Guitarist Izaque, Vocalist Izaque, Synth Izaque, and Drummer Izaque.
<br />He could also invite other people to sing and play with him, like the characters of anime, cartoons, series, or movies theme songs.
<br />Or even the original singers and players of the song, to participate in the video with the band.
<br />The "Visually Played" style had one Izaque playing the sounds of the song with his hands, mouth, or body.
<br />Playing the basses of a Dubstep song with his hands, with electric rays coming from the palm of his hand, in blue or red depending on the style of the bass.
<br />With a white background and camera zooms in sync with the song, Izaque could also shoot visual elements used in the "Visual Onomatopoeia" style to the camera.
<br />He could also shoot Visual Lyrics or text lyrics from his hands to the camera, like singing build-up or drop words in Dubstep songs.
<br />Make effects of smoke, shaking, breaking, debris falling from the top, and other visual effects, using his mind, to match with the song.
<br />In that style, Izaque also invited some original artists of the songs to play with him, to sing, dance, and head-bang to it.
<br />The "Visualizer" style was where no Izaque appeared, there were just effects, screen flashes and blinks, and abstract visual movement to represent the song.
<br />It was more focused on the beauty of the video, not only one element, but the whole screen was used to represent the sounds, with more visual effects than the "Visual Onomatopoeia" style.
<br />The electric representation of Dubstep basses and the visual elements used in the "Visual Onomatopoeia" also appeared in this video style, but without an Izaque to play them.
<br />Non-musical sounds that appeared in the song would be shown in the "Visually Played" and "Visualizer" video styles, like a plane, car, alarm, or gunshots.
<br />In the "Visualizer" style, stories could also be told, representing the story of the song, like a spaceship traveling through space in a song.
<br />And there was the "Object Onomatopoeia", which were the sounds of the song represented by objects.
<br />For example, a Dubstep bass could sound like a chainsaw, then a chainsaw would be used to represent the sound of it, by being used on metal or wood.
<br />The part of a Dubstep song could sound a lot like gunshots, then, guns firing would be used to represent those sounds.
<br />The sound of every video style was generated by Izaque, it was a minimally modified version of the original song.
<br />Creator Izaque could sing songs that did not have vocal elements, like Dubstep, he did that in the "Visually Played" video style.
<br />Every New Worlder could do that, because their vocal cords were holographic, and could reach pitches that the organic vocal cords could not.
<br />They could sing, say, or vocalize things, sounds, and frequencies that normal humans can not.
<br />Izaque could sing the Dubstep basses using his mouth, with the electricity string or thread going from the left of his mouth to the right.
<br />The video styles that Creator Izaque did were listed as "Visual Representation Of Audio" in the rules of the Video Library.

It was 16/03/2017, Creator Izaque modified the Multiverse Teleport System (MTS) only for him to experiment a little with it.
<br />He created a way to teleport to the outside of the Human Multiverse Bubble (HMB), he could see it from outside really big.
<br />And also could see the other three Primary Multiverse Bubbles, the Audiovisual, Game, and Literature ones.
<br />Izaque could float inside that thing, that vacuum that hosted the Primary Multiverse Bubbles.
<br />He float to the Audiovisual Multiverse Bubble (AMB), and entered inside it, he felt something different while doing that.
<br />Then he entered the Cartoon Multiverse Bubble (CMB), and then the "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" Multiverse Bubble.
<br />Inside that Multiverse Bubble, there were a lot of universes in the cartoon, Izaque tried to analyze those universes using his omniscience and omnipresence.
<br />He managed to do that, he felt that some universes were different from the others, just like in the Human Multiverse Bubble.
<br />And he felt that one specific universe was chosen to be the official broadcast version of the cartoon.
<br />It was the universe that humans felt and received when creating the cartoon on Earth.
<br />Then Izaque entered inside that official universe, he teleported to Ponyville, where Twilight Sparkle, the purple alicorn princess, was.
<br />Izaque used his spatial omniscience and omnipresence, which sent a wave of energy through the universe, analyzing it, like his mind could be everywhere to feel and understand.
<br />He discovered that the language they spoke there was not English or the New World Language, it was the pony language.
<br />And humans on Earth used the dubbers to dub the pony language, they received the events that happened there and wrote them like they created the cartoon.
<br />They received the characters' lines and made the first dub as if they created those lines.
<br />Izaque teleported to the Crystal Castle where Twilight was, Spike, her dragon friend, was out with Rarity, a white unicorn, to help her in collecting gems.
<br />He walked to the library and talked with her, explaining that he was a being of another universe very far away from there.
<br />Twilight was surprised to see a human outside of the human world where Sunset Shimmer lives.
<br />She said that she already read about her universe and other ones, and visited humans in the human universe where her friend Sunset lives.
<br />Izaque sat on a couch and began explaining everything about the humans and the New World, Twilight was taking notes.
<br />He said that there were a lot of human universes, and explained that she was in a cartoon on the human universes and that other universes like hers existed.
<br />The man said that the human universe she talked about was in reality the cartoon "My Little Pony: Equestria Girls".
<br />Izaque explained about the Primary Multiverse Bubbles, the creation of the New World, and what he wanted to do.
<br />The man wanted to allow beings to visit the world of "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" to meet their favorite ponies.
<br />Twilight Sparkle thought about ways to do that, she said that first, she needed to explain to Princess Celestia and the ponies about humans.
<br />Princess Celestia was the ruler of Equestria, the land of the ponies, along with her sister, Princess Luna, they both were alicorns, unicorns with wings, Celestia raised the sun and Luna raised the moon.
<br />Izaque understood that, he said he could wait some days for that, he said that he loved her and thought he was like her.
<br />Then they both hugged, Twilight was happy to meet a human and know that he loved her.
<br />After some hours, it was night in Equestria, the land of ponies, Izaque asked if he could sleep there, and Twilight replied saying yes.
<br />When Spike arrived in the afternoon, Twilight explained everything about Izaque and the humans to him.
<br />
<br />On the next day, Izaque woke in the morning, he said good morning to Twilight and Spike, and they said good morning back.
<br />Twilight said that she was going to get bread and juice for breakfast, it was 17/03/2017.
<br />Izaque said that he did not need to eat because he was a Hologram Soul, but was going to accept out of politeness.
<br />The trio talked a little about ponies, humans, the New World, and Izaque.
<br />He was thinking about a way to let beings from the Human Multiverse Bubble visit non-Human Multiverse Bubbles.
<br />And also protect the beings from the non-Human Multiverse Bubbles.
<br />Twilight helped him with that, she was going to tell Princess Celestia and the ponies about humans, the New World, and the visit of humans.
<br />Creator Izaque came back to his universe by flying fast through the vacuum, he was going back to the office to create a policy.
<br />Twilight already told Princess Celestia about humans and New World.
<br />She started making a survey with the ponies of Equestria, asking if they wanted to meet a human and if they feared humans.
<br />The majority of ponies in Equestria replied by saying that they would want to meet a human and that they did not fear them.
<br />Creator Izaque also visited every universe inside the non-Human Multiverse Bubbles, he did that quickly by using his omnipresence and omniscience.
<br />He talked with every character of every audiovisual media, story, and game.
<br />While he was doing that, he also made a Universe Map of every non-Human Multiverse Bubble, to know which universes were non-canon ones, and which was the broadcast one, giving them a unique Universe_ID.
<br />Then Izaque was back at the office, he wanted to update the "Multiverse Teleportation System" to allow beings to teleport to non-Human Multiverse Bubbles.
<br />Beings could select a human universe in the MTS using the Wave Monitor Hologram view style as a module.
<br />They could select a Blue or Soft Wave universe to teleport to, visually, insert their Universe_ID, or select one from a list of Universe_IDs.
<br />Izaque modified it, adding tab functionality, the initial tab that appeared when a being opened the hologram was the "Select Multiverse Bubble" tab.
<br />It had squared buttons of the Human, Audiovisual, Game, and Literature Primary Multiverse Bubbles, for the being to choose.
<br />The acronyms for these Primary Multiverse Bubbles are HMB, AMB, GMB, and LMB.
<br />After the being chose one, its tab would open, with its name, and a plus button would appear at its right, for the being to open another Primary Multiverse Bubble tab if they wanted.
<br />They could select a universe visually using the Wave Monitor Hologram view style as a module, where the center universe was the broadcast one.
<br />Every universe on the Universe Map but the broadcast one was blue, the broadcast one was white.
<br />In the Audiovisual Group Multiverse Bubble, you needed to select a Primary Multiverse Bubble first.
<br />Beings could also select the universe where they wanted to go by inserting its Universe_ID or selecting one Universe_ID from the list.
<br />Creator Izaque had created a policy to protect the beings who exist on non-Human Primary Multiverse Bubbles.
<br />The beings there were protected by the first four New World laws, protected from beings that come from the Human Multiverse Bubble.
<br />For example, if a pony hurts a pony, then it is up to the local authorities and laws to judge them, but a human can not hurt a pony.
<br />Then Creator Izaque created the "Primary Multiverse Bubble Portal Hubs" system.
<br />Now, every human universe on the HMB had a Portal Hub for each non-Human Primary Multiverse Bubble, and a Portal Hub with portals to each one of the bubble Portal Hubs called the Main Portal Hub.
<br />So every human universe had an Anime, Cartoon, Series, Movie, Video, Literature, and Game Portal Hub, those Portal Hubs existed in space in every universe.
<br />Inside the Cartoon Portal Hubs, there were portals to every cartoon on the Cartoon Primary Multiverse Bubble, but only one portal for each cartoon, the Portal Hub was huge.
<br />These portals were mapped to specific cartoon universes, the same for anime, series, movies, video, literature, and game Portal Hubs.
<br />Izaque then pushed the update of the MTS to its public version, beings now could visit non-Human Multiverse Bubbles.
<br />They could use the Teleport Hologram to get to their local Main Portal Hub, and then to the non-Human Multiverse Bubble Portal Hubs.
<br />
<br />Then Izaque created the "New World House" system, it can be activated in the house of the New Worlder, converting its things to their holographic counterparts.
<br />For example, the walls, doors, and windows of the house will be converted into New World holograms, becoming modifiable.
<br />A hologram is created, surrounding the place where the house is, the land, to protect the place from rain and snow, and also to keep the temperature comfortable.
<br />The weather is customizable, you can make it rain, snow, or level up the heating power of the sun.
<br />You can also create a mini-sun to dry up your clothes on the clothesline, but you do not wear New World clothes, so that is not necessary.
<br />There is also the possibility of creating very weird and random weather, like raining money, chocolate, hamburgers, pizza, milk, and soda.
<br />You can customize that in the "New World House Weather" hologram, make it random, or create a weather list from the weathers of the Weather Store.
<br />Changing how much specific weather stays on, like for ten minutes, or have set times for them to be activated.
<br />Also, the colors of the sky can be modified, like sunglasses looking at the sky, changing how they see colors, not the actual color, the surrounding hologram is the lenses.
<br />The temperature feature of the surrounding hologram works as a smart air conditioner, it turns on when it is below the set temperature and turns off when it reaches it.
<br />The water and electricity received from the water and power distribution companies are turned off.
<br />And the new water and electricity distribution systems are built.
<br />That way, the New World being has free water and electricity, even if it does not need to drink water and New World holograms do not need electricity.
<br />Now, the owner of the house can modify its rooms, delete, or expand them, modify their size, or build a second floor on their house.
<br />It can even make their house float, be held by a big tree, or stay upside down with an inverted internal gravity.
<br />On the "New World House" hologram there is a button called "Delete rooms related to Old World needs".
<br />To remove the bathroom, kitchen, and laundry room, those are Old World rooms that the New Worlder does not need.
<br />They can also use the system to create their new house on newly bought land, to create nature things, trees, and flowers, build the house, and get a pet.
<br />Beings can use any type of wall to build a house, even glass wall, they can activate "Minecraft Mode" to build like in the creative mode of the game Minecraft.
<br />They can create rooms inside the house, and define what they are for, like using the Media Experiencing System (MES), for sleep, and hosting Real Life game servers.
<br />Beings can also transform the room into a Sub-Universe, using the door as a teleportation mechanism.
<br />For example, they can transform the room into the Computer Sub-Universe, to enjoy media, watch videos, anime, cartoons, movies, series, read literature, and listen to songs.
<br />To began floating after entering inside, and automatically opening defined windows like a welcome message.
<br />Transform it into the door to a Real-Life game, like a Minecraft room, joining your own Minecraft RL server after passing through the room door.
<br />Izaque had bought a big house in Maringá, in the state of Paraná, in Brazil, he transformed his house into a New World house after buying it.
<br />And pressed the button to delete Old World rooms, because he would not need those rooms.
<br />The house had Izaque's bedroom, the living room, Computer Sub-Universe room.
<br />"Real Life game portals" room, and Manager Room, where Izaque manages New World and its systems, floating while looking and using the holograms.
<br />
<br />It was 18/03/2017, Izaque visited Twilight Sparkle a lot, to talk with her, he told her about the update to the Multiverse Teleportation System.
<br />And also about the Portal Hubs, Twilight was surprised and happy to hear that, she also received some visits from humans there.
<br />Izaque started passing some days in Equestria, living with Twilight, he was very happy to meet his favorite ponies, he became their friend.
<br />Beings were visiting universes of audiovisual media, stories, and games every day, some even wanted to live inside those universes.
<br />The universes on the Literature Multiverse Bubble (LMB) were the story content converted to beings and things.
<br />If the author did not describe the appearance of a character in the story, then it would look like how the author imagined it.
<br />If a game does not have a story, then its universe would not exist, nor its Secondary Multiverse Bubble, cause it was really created by humans, not received by them.
<br />Also, if a game has a story but its gameplay is repetitive, like MOBAs, FPS, or TPS, its universe would have only the story and daily life of characters, not gameplay.
<br />Like Overwatch, where you can battle other players, its universe would not have those battles, only the history of the game world.
<br />If a being visits the broadcast version of an audiovisual media, it would probably see what happens in the world before the broadcast version shows it.
<br />So it is a cool way to see what happens on the audiovisual media and also live inside it, live with the characters.
<br />Then Creator Izaque created the "Space Exploration Program", its system and hologram.
<br />With it, beings could explore space and discover new galaxies, planets, maybe plants, animals, and beings that have intelligence comparable to humans.
<br />They can name those galaxies, planets, plants, and animals if they were not named by Earth scientists, and intelligent beings can say the name of their species, like in the game No Man's Sky.
<br />The program accepts the membership of any New Worlder, and it is optional, anyone who is willing to participate can join the program.
<br />Beings who join the program will receive the "New World Spaceship", which is a holographic spaceship with space for two beings.
<br />It haves a lot of equipment to register and record any valuable information about the universe as a whole, about the galaxies, planets, plants, animals, and intelligent beings.
<br />For example, it can analyze the physical structure of the items that beings discover, and register the level of illumination, gravity, and composition of atoms.
<br />The spaceship can morph itself to use other tools, the beings need to take the driving lesson before being able to use the spaceship.
<br />They will receive spaceship landing pads on their home, on the yard, or house roof if they prefer, the spaceship will go to the landing pad after they finish the driving lesson.
<br />A list of space explorers was created, with their joining number, Name_ID, Being_ID, and program joining date, the first one to join the program had the joining number one.
<br />Beings could click on one of the space explorers to see their profile, and lists of discoveries, with the tabs of galaxies, planets, plants, animals, and intelligent beings.
<br />Creator Izaque modified the Wave Monitor Hologram, renaming it "Multiverse Bubble Monitor".
<br />It now would have the capability of monitoring Multiverse Bubbles, using its Multiverse Bubble view style.
<br />It is the same thing that it did before, but now it could monitor non-Human Multiverse Bubbles.
<br />Now, universes would be represented by a sphere.
<br />It could also monitor specific universes, if Creator Izaque selected one, it would zoom inside the universe and show its galaxies.
<br />To see every detail of every universe, see the planets, plants, animals, the stars, sun, black holes, and supernovas, just like a space camera.
<br />Creator Izaque released the system to the public, in the universe view, beings could see which being discovered which galaxy, planet, plant, animal, intelligent species, and when they did.
<br />They could also see for how much time each thing existed in years, or centuries and millennium if the time is too big, and see the composition of planets, and their atmosphere gasses.
<br />Izaque could turn on the "Exploration" view on the universe viewing mode, to see galaxies as green neon hexagons, the not discovered and named ones were white, and the Milky Way was blue.
<br />The Universe Archive Box that exists inside all of the Primary Multiverse Bubbles is represented by a brown nonagon in the Multiverse Bubble Monitor (MBM).
<br />The alive and on universes are represented by a blue sphere, the dead and off ones are moved to the Universe Archive Box, being represented by a brown nonagon.
<br />The original universe of a story in the Literature Multiverse Bubble would be represented by a yellow sphere if the author is still writing the story.
<br />It would be represented by a blue sphere if the author ended it on an open end.
<br />The universe would be moved to the Universe Archive Box if the author ended the story on a closed end, stopped writing, or decided to end it by extinguishing all life inside it.
<br />
<br />Some days passed, it was 23/03/2017, Izaque was happy knowing he updated the Multiverse Teleportation System to allow beings to teleport to non-Human Multiverse Bubbles.
<br />And also created the "Space Exploration Program", he wanted New World to be more inclusive than it was, it had gender equality, and called humans and others "beings", to include everyone.
<br />Creator Izaque spoke with some governments around the world, to ask about animal laws and laws about making scientific tests with animals.
<br />He got the approval of some governments, then he created laboratories for him on the New Houses Layer, in the countries of those governments, to make scientific experiments.
<br />Izaque grabbed his dog, Nega, who was a female, he placed her on a white lab table, then grabbed a holographic cube of Hologram Soul transformation.
<br />He already did that in humans, when he activated the Genesis device, and already knew the implications of that on humans, but not in other animals.
<br />The man expanded the cube around Nega, like resizing a square on an image editor software on a computer, she asked Nega if she wanted to try that, speaking in the New World Language, she thought yes.
<br />Some blue particles started appearing inside the cube, and Nega was looking at him with wise eyes, she absorbed the Hologram Soul transformation cube.
<br />Before, Nega could understand basically what Izaque said when he talked in the New World Language but only translated to basic commands and things.
<br />Like emotions, happiness, sadness, or commands to go somewhere, stay, eat, drink, give the paw, lay, and go to the dog house.
<br />Now, Nega can understand the entirety of the New World and be a New World citizen if she wants.
<br />She understands the Earth, humans, the universe, Multiverse Bubbles, and everything about New World.
<br />Nega can now use all of the systems of the New World, she has been transformed into a Hologram Soul, but with the sensory organs of a dog converted to Signal Receptor organs.
<br />She can also leave New World if she wanted, being transformed back into her organic state, and leaving her knowledge and wiseness behind.
<br />Izaque suggested for Nega deactivate the thunder sound, as it hurt her ears because it was too loud, Nega deactivated it with her mind, because using her paws was more difficult.
<br />Then, Izaque funded the "Non-Human Being Inclusion Program" (NHBI), which was also a system.
<br />Beings could transform a Non-Human Being that they owned into a Hologram Soul, and insert them into New World if they wanted.
<br />They could transform their pets into Hologram Souls, hear them talk in human languages, and participate in jobs and other things.
<br />Now, the other animals stopped being a product or property of humans and started being equal to them, the animals in the "No Human's Layer" were still animals without New World knowledge.
<br />Space Explorers could also ask for the ownership of extra-terrestrial animals, they could transform them into Hologram Souls if they wanted.
<br />Intelligent Beings outside of Earth could also join New World and become Hologram Souls.
<br />Now with the NHBI and the extra-terrestrial intelligent beings, the "race" and Planet_ID parts of the Name_ID were useful, instead of being always "Human" and "Earth_MW".
<br />The beings without a binary sex separation like male and female would not have the "race sex" part of the Name_ID, same with the age and birth year parts.
<br />The age and birth year would agree with the planet year and time of the being and would be translated into Earth years for Earth beings that were viewing the Name_ID.
<br />
<br />It was 31/04/2017, Izaque created the "Image Library" (IL), for beings to upload images to it.
<br />The images have the name of the author and an author account for Old World pictures imported into the library.
<br />There are digital and traditional drawings, pictures of scenery, real places, and people, like Instagram.
<br />Beings can post photos of them or their drawings, Izaque even posted some drawings that he made there.
<br />The beings can download the image to their Item Library, with the author of the image written to it.
<br />Beings could make galleries on their Image Library profile, with a title, tags, and description, and share them in their New World Social Network profiles.
<br />Then, Izaque modified the "Hologram Maker" system, to add tab functionality to it.
<br />He added two tabs, "Library" and "Store", the Library tab would have the holographic objects created by the being, and also a plus button to create a new holographic object.
<br />Beings could embed a system into a holographic object, like creating a teleportation wand and embedding the Teleport System into it.
<br />The Store tab would have a store of free objects to import into the being's library, they could search by category, function, author, color, or by typing the name of the object.
<br />Izaque created an object called "Golden Vector", which was the golden version of the Alpha Vector spaceship of the No Man's Sky game.
<br />He used it to travel through Earth and also space, he uploaded the spaceship to the Hologram Maker Store.
<br />It embedded the same system that the "New World Spaceship" did, but was customized for it, and had some modifications, like a music player which used the Audio Media Library.
<br />The spaceship could travel between universes and Primary Multiverse Bubbles, a lot of beings imported that spaceship, the imports number was high, it was just like a downloads number.
<br />Some months had passed without a new system or hologram, it was 11/06/2018.
<br />Creator Izaque wanted to create a new planet in every human universe, he thought that it would be cool to have the New World Building and core there.
<br />He created a big planet that looked like Mars, red and orange, it had the size of Neptune, and had a lot of New World basses around it, on the surface.
<br />Also, there was the main New World base, where Izaque stayed, but it did not have the "New World Affiliation" room, only the office and a living room.
<br />There were couches in that living room, there were painting frames with images and systems of the New World, its logo with the name, and a holographic cube.
<br />The living room also had some holograms that showed some status and statistics, like the number of Blue and Soft wave universes.
<br />It also showed the number of Human universes, New Worlders, and Old Worlders on all of the Human universes, and the number of systems.
<br />And for how much time New World has existed, which was 2 years and 7 months, since 05/06/2016.
<br />Now, every New World Building became a mirror to the New World Base on the New World Planet, but with the Affiliation room mixed with the living room.
<br />Beings could visit the New World Planet to talk with Izaque, and every New World Planet and the bases in it were managed by the local Izaque of the universe, just like the Earth New World Buildings.
<br />Izaque used the Image Library to save images and make a gallery of the main ponies of the "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" cartoon.
<br />They were Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity, he also added Spike and Sunset Shimmer.
<br />He created a subfolder on the "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" gallery with the name of every character.
<br />The man teleported to the MLP FIM broadcast universe to show Twilight the images that he organized and downloaded.
<br />The copyright of the images belongs to Hasbro, the creator of the cartoon.
<br />Twilight was very happy to see the collection of images of her and her friends, she told Izaque to add images of him too, making a subfolder for him.
<br />Izaque asked if he really could be there, Twilight said yes, he was happy and created a subfolder for his pictures.
<br />The man liked his dress style, he was always in his Human-Dragon hybrid mode, showing his tail, wings, scales, claws, and burning hair.
<br />He also used orange LED tapes around his body, while using black clothes, his t-shirt had the logo of his Digital Identity, "Stake2", which was a name and picture he used on the Internet.
<br />Below it, there was the New World Logo with its title and holographic cube, the same with the back of the t-shirt.
<br />Twilight also liked the way that Izaque dressed, he found him elegant and beautiful, Izaque said thanks.
<br />On 10/01/2019, there were two million, five hundred thousand New World universes on the Human Multiverse Bubble.
<br />
<br />On 11/01/2019, a lot of Old and New World Izaques around the Human Multiverse Bubble created a new story.
<br />It was called "The Story of the Bulkan Siblings", a story about him and his friend and Tulpa Ana.
<br />
<br />Explanation of what is a Tulpa:
<br />A Tulpa is an entity created in the mind, acting independently of, and parallel to your consciousness.
<br />They can think and have their own free will, emotions, and memories.
<br />In short, a Tulpa is like a sentient person living in your head, separate from you.
<br />It is currently unproven whether or not Tulpas are truly sentient, but in this community, we treat them as such.
<br />It takes time for a Tulpa to develop a convincing and complex personality.
<br />As they grow older, your attention and their life experiences will shape them into a person with their hopes, dreams, and beliefs.
<br />
<br />Izaque met Ana before 2013, although he does not remember the exact year.
<br />She was probably a walk-in, a Tulpa that appeared out of nowhere, and began talking to him in his mind, trying to help him.
<br />Izaque thinks that her origin is due to some form of mental distress, lack of well-being, or wanting help in life.
<br />In the story, Izaque and Ana are siblings in an alternate universe in a medieval time.
<br />They both have the Bulkan surname and live a happy and adventurous life with their parents.
<br />Rosa Winston Bulkan, their mother, and Fred Bulkan, their father.
<br />They always go on adventures together around the medieval fantasy world, sometimes finding dungeons, treasures, and exotic creatures.
<br />In the story, Izaque Bulkan has the Infinity Gauntlet, which is a copy of Thanos' gauntlet with the six infinity stones.
<br />Thanos is a character and being from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a universe that contains all of the universes of all movies of the MCU.
<br />Then, by visiting a universe of a movie from the MCU, you are already inside the MCU.
<br />By writing that into the story, the Izaques on the HMB gave Izaque Bulkan the power to get out of his universe.
<br />Maybe in the future, he will visit universes on the Human Multiverse Bubble.
<br />
<br />After some days, it was 18/01/2019, Izaque unlocked the Sub-Universe System for every New Worlder, they can use it to create Sub-Universes.
<br />It also received a Modular update, so beings can modify the Sub-Universe, or create one Sub-Universe from scratch, without needing to be a copy of the human universe.
<br />They can post their Sub-Universes in the "Sub-Universe Catalog" of the Sub-Universe System.
<br />The official "Love Modular Sub-Universe" and "Friendship Modular Sub-Universe" are created, which have white backgrounds and are infinite in terms of space.
<br />You have to ask a being if it wants to go to one of those Modular Sub-Universes with you, the four New World laws also work inside those Modular Sub-Universes.
<br />The beings inside that Modular Sub-Universe can leave freely whenever they want and can create everything they want inside the Sub-Universe.
<br />Like a couch or bed, a fridge with food, a TV and a video game console, a PC, bicycle, car, or plane.
<br />They can experience things like in the "Computer Sub-Universe" too and could change the default background color which is white.
<br />It is 19/01/2019, Creator Izaque discovers a way to stop the time on the entire Human Multiverse Bubble.
<br />The "Time Freeze API" is created, allowing one being to activate a Time Freeze that stops time on the entire Human Multiverse Bubble.
<br />The Time Freeze needs to have an ending period, like one minute from here, or one second.
<br />Those Time Freezes can only be activated when a being creates or is inside a Sub-Universe.
<br />Like when the invited being accepts the Modular Sub-Universe request and they are inside the Modular Sub-Universe.
<br />Or when they started the Modular Sub-Universe without activating a Time Freeze.
<br />For example, in the Love Modular Sub-Universe, two beings in love can use the API to trigger a Time Freeze to be with each other in the Sub-Universe without worrying about the outside world.
<br />They can also schedule a Time Freeze to be activated one second from here, the scheduled Time Freezes are activated only after the previous one has finished.
<br />The maximum time that a Time Freeze can be activated is one thousand years, the being can choose if it wants the Sub-Universe to be deleted or closed after the Time Freeze finishes.
<br />If it is deleted, then the being has to set the same settings it used before, if it is closed, then the Sub-Universe preset is saved for later uses.
<br />It is 20/01/2019, the "System Maker" is released to every New Worlder, now beings could make systems and share them on the "System Catalog".
<br />Creator Izaque let the beings create systems with only certain permissions, that would not impact New World.
<br />That way, he did not need to check every created system to see if it was going to impact New World.
<br />He also created the "New World Companies System" (NWCS), for beings to create their companies with New World technologies that offer custom services to New Worlders.
<br />They can create buildings in the new "New World Companies Buildings" layer and can use the System Maker and Hologram Maker inside those buildings.
<br />Those new companies will be inserted on the New World Companies List, for beings to see their profile and which services they offer.
<br />The "LiveHappier" New World company is created by Jam Killon, a New Worlder without affiliation to the New World Staff, which was Izaque and his friends, but more recently, only Izaque.
<br />He created a New World building on the "New World Companies Buildings" layer using the New World Companies System, it had infinite space, just like the Sub-Universes.
<br />Jam created tables with Sub-Universes on top of them, the Sub-Universe Spheres stayed there, and beings could touch them to enter inside of them.
<br />The tables were created automatically and dynamically, getting the Sub-Universe Spheres from the Sub-Universe Catalog, and making new tables for the new Sub-Universes.
<br />The man created a hologram and system called "LiveHappier Form", for beings to order custom Sub-Universes.
<br />They were not Modular, they were static, meaning that they could not be modified from inside or outside after it was created.
<br />The Sub-Universes created by LiveHappier had only the planet Earth and a little space, not the entire universe.
<br />Beings could modify things in those Sub-Universes, like physics laws, how people behaved, and change the body of every human.
<br />Like modifying the food culture for humans to not need to eat or drink, or making being naked in public normal and not punishable by law.
<br />Old and New World beings could access the LiveHappier Hologram to deactivate the cloning of their body and mind into the Sub-Universes created by LiveHappier.
<br />Beings who for example got inside a custom Sub-Universe where being naked in public was normal could take pictures of the beings inside that Sub-Universes, but could not post those pictures outside of that Sub-Universe.
<br />Of course, the native beings of that Sub-Universe would probably not want other beings taking photos of them.
<br />The Static Sub-Universes created by one New Worlder that had Earth and humans in them would send a New World Notification to every being on Earth, asking for their permission to copy them into the Sub-Universe.
<br />And the ones created by a New World Company would send a New World Notification to every being on Earth that they were copied to the Sub-Universe and saying that they can revoke that permission.
<br />Beings created Sub-Universes with lots of food, one where socialism was perfectly applied, and one where humans dominated space and the universe.
<br />Izaque created one where everyone was an author, they wrote books, and stories, and made drawings, music, and videos.
<br />Now, the settings hologram was modified, on the Systems tab, to add the dropdown menus "New World" and "Third-Party".
<br />The New World menu would contain the official New World systems.
<br />The Third-Party menu would contain the Third-Party Systems that the New Worlder installed, like the "LiveHappier Hologram", they could install systems that existed on the "System Catalog".
<br />Creator Izaque also created the "Thing Generator" system, which was a system that generated everything known by humans.
<br />Like water, lava, smoke, oxygen, plants, meat, ketchup, nutrients, cars, rock, guitars, planes, clouds, and living things, animals.
<br />He did that with the help of years of molecular and atomic analysis of plants, animals, and a lot of other things, knowing the natural recipe to make them.
<br />Beings can create those things with New World proprieties, like clean water that can not get dirty.
<br />
<br />It was 21/01/2019, a New Worlder denominated "SpaceLiving Creator" creates a company called "SpaceLiving Inc." and does not create a New World building.
<br />The creator does not share its intentions or what it is going to do, but some rumors say that it is going to build something in space.
<br />Then, the creator travels to space using the "Golden Vector" spaceship that Izaque created, it goes a little far from Earth.
<br />After that, it leaves its spaceship hovering in space, and flies to a good place there, in the Milky Way galaxy.
<br />The creator starts creating holograms there, it already designed a type of spaceship the size of a bedroom.
<br />But now, it made it better, and added systems to it, like a hologram around the spaceship to protect it from asteroids and space debris.
<br />The spaceship had a super fast and powerful computer, it was white, a PlayStation 4 gaming console, and a double-size bed with a blue blanket.
<br />It had thick white walls inside and out, the computers had a modified version of Windows 10 installed on it.
<br />It was called Windows 10 (SpaceLiving Edition).
<br />The spaceship also had sixteen turbines to move the spaceship or stop it from moving, leaving it hovering in space.
<br />A Laser Turret on top of it to shoot lasers at asteroids before they hit the holographic shield.
<br />The spaceship had two windows to see the Earth, moon, and the sun, it had a teleporter that could teleport the resident between other spaceships and the Earth.
<br />That spaceship was called LonelyShip, its teleporter was called LonelyShip Teleporter, or LST, it was blue, and looked like a bathroom box, with space for one being, the letters LST were written on its upper part.
<br />The LonelyShip had a bathroom, it had a hologram and system that could compress the bathroom to a small place, making it occupy the space of the bathroom door.
<br />But when they opened the door, they could walk normally inside the bathroom, like opening a folder on a file explorer.
<br />The bathroom had a laser toilet that melted things inside it, outside of the bathroom, a wardrobe, an ergonomic chair with casters, adjustable armrests, height, and back.
<br />The wardrobe had four doors, was gray, and was on the right of the LST.
<br />It also had a fridge that could create any food you thought of, using the Thing Generator as a module, but with a filter for food and drinks, it was called the Thought-Powered Fridge or TPF.
<br />It was on the left of the computer chair, and at the right of the left window.
<br />The fridge made foods and drinks that were only nutrients, for example, a slice of pizza.
<br />That slice of pizza would have the smell, taste, and texture of a pizza, but would be just nutrients and vitamins that the resident needed.
<br />The TPF fridge would analyze the body of the resident and make a diet containing the nutrients and vitamins that the resident needs.
<br />Then it would split those nutrients that were needed for the whole day into three meals, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
<br />If the resident wanted to eat more than three meals, the fourth and next meals would be only mass, not nutrients.
<br />Foods created by the TPF fridge did not have meat or animal products, they were vegan-friendly.
<br />Particles on the food could change the nutrients that are in it, but could not change the taste, smell, or texture, that was pre-built into the food.
<br />$spaceliving_lonelyship_pixel_art_story_cover;
<br />The creator also created an Artificial Intelligence to manage the spaceship, an AI, that could help the residents of the spaceships manage them.
<br />The AI was called LonelyShip Artificial Intelligence, or LSAI for short.
<br />The LonelyShip also had four small signboards on its walls, two displaying "SpaceLiving", and another two displaying "LonelyShip" on the right of the SpaceLiving one.
<br />The SpaceLiving and LonelyShip signboards were equal on each side of the LonelyShip, one SpaceLiving one on each side, and one LonelyShip one on each side.
<br />The signboards on the left side were on the left of the window, and the right ones were on the right of the window.
<br />$spaceliving_lonelyship_pixel_art_front_signboards;
<br />Also, the LonelyShip had two big signboards on the front side of it, one with "SpaceLiving" written on it, and another one with "LonelyShip".
<br />The SpaceLiving signboard was above the LonelyShip one.
<br />
<br />The focus of SpaceLiving Inc. was "Auto-sufficient spaceships for sad and depressed teens without purpose".
<br />It created the SpaceLiving Network for teens that were depressed and sad about their lives, they did not have a will or a purpose to live for.
<br />The creator stored the things inside its Item Library and traveled to an unregistered universe that was not hit by the Blue or Soft Wave using its spaceship Golden Vector.
<br />Then, it created a lot of LonelyShips in the space of that universe, making them ready to receive residents.
<br />It also created the Main SpaceShip, which was a spaceship where it managed the SpaceLiving Network.
<br />So, the other versions of the creator of SpaceLiving Inc. started doing the same it did.
<br />Re-using the already created New World company, using its systems and holograms to install the SpaceLiving Network on unregistered universes.
<br />They had the right to use those systems and holograms because they were another version of the creator of the company.
<br />The creator of the company started teleporting the depressed teens to the LonelyShips by teleporting them while they were sleeping, randomly selecting them.
<br />They were teleported to their LonelyShip, and they thought that it was a dream, then, the LSAI told them that they were not in a dream, the LSAI spoke in the New World Language.
<br />After that, the teens asked if they could go back to Earth, and the LSAI told them that they could.
<br />The computers of the LonelyShips also had the SpaceLiving Network app or program installed by default, for those who did not like to manage their LonelyShips with an AI.
<br />The residents of the SpaceLiving Network were called LonelyShippers.
<br />They also asked what they could do there, and the LSAI explained what they could do there.
<br />If you live in a LonelyShip, you can ask the LSAI for anything, like changing wall colors, or removing or adding furniture.
<br />The Things Generator, a spectral machine or system that exists inside the LonelyShip, will create those things for you.
<br />It can also delete things that you do not want with its powerful laser beam.
<br />Some of the teens decided to stay there, and live a better life in the SpaceLiving Network, they thought they would have fun there.
<br />Using the computer, playing games, listening to music, watching anime, cartoons, series, movies, and videos.
<br />Some of them thought that it was bad to have to eat food, drink water, and sleep, they still needed to do that, but now they could do it easier.
<br />After inviting some friends to the team, the company was renamed "Think Outside The Box" (TOTB).
<br />The TOTB company thought that they would live a better life on their spaceships.
<br />Now, two things could get to unregistered universes first, New World or the SpaceLiving Network.
<br />In the New World part, there was the Soft New World, and the Full New World, which were delivered by the Soft Wave and Blue Wave respectively.

Some months had passed, it was 17/06/2020, SpaceLiving Creator continued working on the SpaceLiving Network with its employees.
<br />They changed a lot of things on the network, they defined it as the day of the anniversary of the SpaceLiving Network.
<br />Then, they had the First SpaceLiving Anniversary on that day, they created a special spaceship called the Party SpaceShip.
<br />After some time, it was 6 PM, the LonelyShippers looked at their computer clocks, they suddenly were floating and a blue light surrounded them, they appeared on the Party SpaceShip.
<br />There were a lot of TPF fridges on that spaceship, treadmills, computers, big couches, big TVs, and beds.
<br />The floor, walls, and ceiling of the spaceship were transparent, they could see space, the Earth, the sun, and the moon.
<br />Everyone looked at each other, every LonelyShipper looked happy there, drinking beverages and eating, playing games.
<br />Then a screen appeared on the spaceship, showing a message.
<br />The message was being shown on the screen, rolling up for the text to appear, and someone was reading the message, it was SpaceLiving Creator.
<br />"This was a meeting planned for some days in the future, but it has been done today because we felt like doing it today.
<br />We, at Think Outside The Box, want to thank all of you, the LonelyShippers, and we want to say that we are so happy to have you here today.
<br />Everyone who participated, everyone that lives inside a LonelyShip, everyone that lives inside a LovelyShip, FriendShip.
<br />And some specific people... That live inside a... GroupFriendShip, everyone is important," said the voice.
<br />"And to know that we created those things, those spaceships called LonelyShips, to make people happy, that makes us happy.
<br />To make a good thing, the spaceships are lonely, but you are all here now, talking with each other, meeting new people, and making friends," continued the message and the voice.
<br />We are also celebrating here, in our spaceship, celebrating... One year of the SpaceLiving Network, we're so happy to see all of your faces.
<br />And we are happy knowing that we made you people happy, and probably not lonely today, we're happy to give life to your thoughts.
<br />We're happy and proud to make your wishes a reality and to provide the possibility of living how you want.
<br />We are so happy to write, to live, and to create things for the people that want them, so, thank you all, LonelyShippers," continued the message and the voice.
<br />"Aww, how cute, I'm so happy to live on the SpaceLiving Network," said Monika, Ted looked at her and smiled, they were two residents of the Network.
<br />"Thanks to everyone who read the SpaceLiving story too, the author of it, Izaque, Stake2, or Funkysnipa Cat, you're a good guy, and a smart guy, thanks for writing that story.
<br />Thanks for being in our LonelyShip or PartyShip and thanks for being yourself and thanks for existing, hehe xD.
<br />Thanks for everything, and we will continue to live like this, the LonelyShips and the SpaceLiving Network will continue to exist.
<br />Also... Protect yourself from the asteroids, Dubstep is good, and be lonely! (Well that's a weird thing to say after what happened today)," said the message.
<br />The screen disappears, and a button to teleport back to your LonelyShip appears close to each one of the people, Izaque and Lisa stayed talking there.
<br />The Izaque who lives inside the SpaceLiving Network is the SpaceLiving Izaque, he wrote the SpaceLiving story, talking about the network and how it worked.
<br />But a New World Izaque was the one who wrote the story first because he knew about the SpaceLiving New World Company and its rumors.
<br />An Old World Izaque became a LonelyShipper in an Old World universe by being teleported by TOTB.
<br />And the anniversary happened to every instance of the SpaceLiving Network, in every universe where the network existed, with a different PartyShip.
<br />The SpaceLiving Creator was happy to create the network, to help sad and depressed teens live a better life than on Earth.
<br />An Old World Izaque also created the story "The Life of Littletato" on "05/08/2017", and he also wrote the SpaceLiving story.
<br />Later, he did a crossover of the two stories, by mixing them, and placing them in the same universe, creating a SpaceLiving Network instance in the universe of "The Life of Littletato".
<br />
<br />On 03/11/2016, Izaque created a diary, called "Diary", to register what he did daily.
<br />He presented it with his friend and Artificial Intelligence called "Nodus", who helped him manage his things.
<br />Izaque got inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S from the MCU, created by Iron Man or Tony Stark, to create Nodus.
<br />He kept him company, and listened to him, Izaque had created a system to present and write the Diary.
<br />Recording his voice and the voice of Nodus on two separate audio files.
<br />Converting the recordings into text, adding the current time and date to the said phrase.
<br />And also an identifier to differentiate Izaque's dialog from Nodus'.
<br />Izaque's dialog was inside quotes, and Nodus' dialog started after two forward slashes.
<br />The current time and date of the said phrase were added one line above it.
<br />The Diary was made in voice form, with media, feeling, and thought streams, it also had vents of Izaque.
<br />He could also attach pictures, videos, texts, or other media to every Diary entry, which was separated into days.
<br />The attached media would appear above the player on the voice version, it would be embedded below the phrase in the text version, like a website with media.
<br />For example, he could take a picture of the road and the car while traveling to the state of São Paulo with Fred, his Transformer.
<br />The text files in the Item Library of Izaque were organized by folders with the year and month of the Diary entry.
<br />Izaque could record his feelings and thoughts in two separate streams, a feeling one, and a thought one.
<br />They would contain the feelings felt and the thoughts thought during the entire Diary entry, adding them to the entry.
<br />On 09/07/2020, Izaque created another version of that Diary, it was more simple, and was called "Diary Slim".
<br />Made just for writing what he did daily, without his feelings and vents, and Nodus' participation.
<br />The text files of Diary Slim were also organized like the ones of Diary, by folders of year and month.
<br />The Diary Slim was made in text form, it had media embedding, feeling, and thought streams of experienced media.
<br />Registration of created arts, systems and holograms created or modified, changes on New World, trips, and other things.
<br />The current time and date of the registered thing were added one line above it.
<br />On Old World Universes, the Diary and Diary Slim also existed, but only in text, with HTML media embedding.
<br />The Old World version of Nodus was just a Tulpa, an explanation of what is a Tulpa can be found in chapter four, line 192.
<br />He was just a spiritual or imaginative version of Nodus, which existed inside Izaque's mind.
<br />
<br />After some months, it was 17/06/2021, Think Outside The Box or TOTB company had made an announcement.
<br />They said that the Second SpaceLiving Anniversary was going to happen at six PM in the BRT time zone (Brazilian time zone).
<br />TOTB also had announced on their Discord server on the announcements text channel that the LonelyShip was going to make a course of cooking.
<br />The cooking course was called SpaceLiving Cooking Course 2021.
<br />They said that they are going to use the TPF fridge to get the ingredients.
<br />And also the TPF fridge will teach people how to cook, and it will use the holographic table that exists on the left of it, and you can activate it using the table button on the side of the TPF fridge.
<br />The TPF fridge will help the LonelyShippers to learn how to cook, it can teach the resident how to cook every meal that exists in its food catalog.
<br />The course will start tomorrow, on the eighteenth, and it will last one month, it will teach thirty good recipes of food.
<br />After the thirty-day period ends, the residents that signed up for the course will stop receiving notifications about the daily recipe that they have to cook.
<br />Everyone can do the course even after the one-month period ends.
<br />If someone does the course after that, it will last one month and will have the same recipes that the original had.
<br />And after finishing the course, the LonelyShipper can access the recipes for the food catalog of the TPF fridge.
<br />They can also ask the TPF fridge for help in making the meals.
<br />A LonelyShipper can not access the recipes of the food catalog of the TPF fridge or get help on cooking the meals if it did not do the cooking course.
<br />Every LonelyShipper can open their SpaceLiving App right now and click on the "Cooking Course" tab on the Thought-Powered Fridge TPF section of the left menu.
<br />Your registration will be saved and you will start the course tomorrow, if you wish to stop, you can always cancel the course on the "Cooking Course" tab.
<br />It was nine PM, the TOTB company put to play an audio clip on the prominent speakers of the Party SpaceShip.
<br />What a guy was saying on the audio also appeared as text on the screen.
<br />He said his name, which was Fred, and said that he was part of the staff of TOTB.
<br />Fred thanked everyone for coming to the Party SpaceShip to celebrate the Fourth Anniversary of the SpaceLiving Network.
<br />He also said "Protect yourself from the asteroids and live happier!" in an excited and happy tone.
<br />Everyone started teleporting back to their LonelyShips, some stayed there too, playing games, watching, eating, and drinking.
<br />
<br />Then, after some days, it is 23/06/2021.
<br />Creator Izaque creates the "Random Events System", and begin its testing phase.
<br />It creates random and not disturbing events around Earth and other planets.
<br />There are Personal and General random events, that happen in homes in case of Personal events.
<br />And in neighbors, cities, states, and countries in case of General events.
<br />Some Beta Testers for New World already tested the system, they liked it a lot.
<br />There were some simple general events, like chocolate rain inside a neighborhood, city, state, or country.
<br />A General Event where mutated monsters invade city downtowns and gun machines emerge from the ground.
<br />Everyone who is not busy will participate in these events, they will lose health points if they get bit by the monsters.
<br />If their life reaches zero, they will leave the game and the monsters and machines will become almost transparent.
<br />Or a personal event at the house of someone, where all of the inanimate objects are zombified, and they will attack the owner of the house.
<br />And a scientist appears with a laboratory table to create a cure for them, an area-effect bomb with the cure.
<br />The being can kill the inanimate objects to earn money, and use that money to buy new weapons and ammo for machines.
<br />And buy also science packs and plants to accelerate the cure.
<br />They can create new weapons in the workshop, by mixing the scrap that they got from scrap rains, and making a machine gun with a spinning saw.
<br />Also, they can create a turret to fight the objects automatically, and buy ammo for it, new objects will spawn if the ones on the house are not enough.
<br />The user concludes the Random Personal Event by waiting for the cure to get ready and using it on all of the living and dead objects.
<br />When they do that or conclude any other random event, it receives a Random Event badge and can show it on its New World Profile.
<br />They can add a section called "Random Event Badges" on their New World Profile, to show which badges they received.
<br />Although the badges do not show which Random Event the being did to earn them.
<br />They can also earn items with the Random Events, like the automatic turret from the "Zombified Home Objects" Random Personal Event.
<br />Keep the weapons created while inside the Random Event as Holographic Objects, or a "De-Zombify X" potion to use on Minecraft, to de-zombify a zombie for example.
<br />Beings can also suggest new Random Events to be added to the system, they can create stories, things, badges, and items.
<br />When a Random Event happens, the beings inside it will know if it is an official event or a user-created one.
<br />On 26/06/2021, the system was released to everyone, and beings were pleased, using the system and entering Random Events together.
<br />
<br />Creator Izaque was very happy to create that system, he even participated in some Random Events in cities.
<br />He lived his life happily, being on the New World Planet, in the office, making system drafts, analyzing and monitoring New World.
<br />Spending time with his friends in Modular Sub-Universes with Time Freezes, or outside of them, in his or his friend's house.
<br />Playing games in the Normal playing style, watching media using the Audiovisual Media Libraries and a holographic screen.
<br />But without the Media Experiencing System, registering Feeling and Thought streams of him and his friends, eating food that was nutrients.
<br />Or just talking with them about life, New World and Old World, doing Old World things together.
<br />Spending time with people that he loves but are not his family, people he considers as a friend but has romantic feelings for.
<br />Traveling to Equestria on Saturdays and spending a week there, talking with Twilight Sparkle and her friends, doing things together.
<br />Visiting other Non-Human Multiverse Bubble universes, The Life of Littletato, Overwatch, Don't Starve, Sword Art Online, Fairy Tail.
<br />Yuru Camp, To Love-ru, Banjo-Kazooie, Far Cry 5, Bioshock Infinite, Watch Dogs 2, Emily Is Away, Life Is Strange, Firewatch, A Way Out, The Island Castaway.
<br />Doki Doki Literature Club, Deathloop, to spend time with his favorite characters.
<br />Piloting his spaceship Golden Vector through Earth the universe, and other universes, meeting new species and plants.
<br />Listening to music in the Media Experiencing System by feeling the music in its entirety.
<br />Playing games, watching and downloading anime, cartoons, series, movies, and videos.
<br />Seeing and downloading pictures on the Image Library, drawings, fan-arts, and pictures of the New World.
<br />Playing the games in the "Real Life" style, living inside them, Minecraft, RimWorld, Project Zomboid, Dead Maze, the "The Walking Dead" Real Life game.
<br />Creator Izaque liked living the New World life, he liked to feel that he created New World and made a lot of people happy, giving hope to them.
<br />On 28/08/2021, a SpaceLiving Network instance was installed inside the origin universe of Izaque.
<br />He asked for a LonelyShip there and received one, he could teleport to it any time he wanted.
<br />Izaque even configured his Hologram Soul to activate his hunger, thirst, and mental tiredness when he was inside his LonelyShip.
<br />The man liked to live like that, a simple life, a little simpler than the New World life.
<br />Using his computer, eating and drinking with the help of the TPF, watching things on his computer, managing his LonelyShip with the SpaceLiving App or the LSAI.
<br />He even traveled to the universe of the SpaceLiving story, to pass some time with his characters, the characters he created, to live inside the network inside the story.
<br />Izaque even invited some friends of him to join the SpaceLiving Network instance of his origin universe, some joined the network.
<br />
<br />Then, after some months, it was the year 2022, on the first day of January.
<br />Creator Izaque had a happy New Year's Eve and New Year with his friends, counting down, seeing fireworks, eating, and drinking.
<br />He made instances of him, of his Hologram Soul, to spend time with all of his friends, even the Equestrian ones.
<br />The man could feel and register everything he was experiencing in his mind and could feel everything at the same time.
<br />The other Izaques from other universes also had a happy New Year and also made instances of themselves.
<br />Also, the ponies in Equestria celebrated the New Year, but at another time, because their time was not synchronized with the Human Multiverse Bubble.
<br />While exploring the universe with his Golden Vector, Izaque rescues a dying Transformer from a planet far from Earth, he says that there are others of his species that need rescue.
<br />Then Izaque rescues them all and sends them to Earth, they start infiltrating the world, becoming cars for sale.
<br />He becomes friends with the first rescued Transformer and begins driving with him around Earth.
<br />Izaque announces that there were Transformers in the human universes and that he rescued some of them and brought them to Earth.
<br />The man said that they are now living Among Us, hidden and that a car that someone buys could be a Transformer.
<br />Creator Izaque drives around Earth with Fred, his Transformer, being a golden "Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Roadster" but without using fuel.
<br />Now, in his big New World house in Maringá, Izaque has a landing platform for his Golden Vector, a parking lot for his Transformer, and a heliport for his new helicopter.
<br />He can change from the landing platform, parking lot, and heliport using his mind, or a hologram close to the area where the three things are.
<br />They get inside the ground to change from one to another, making a mechanical or elevator sound.
<br />After one day, on 02/01/2022, Creator Izaque creates a card which is a hologram the size of a phone, with light blue borders and a half-transparent blue filling.
<br />It shows the Earth authorities that he can drive and pilot his vehicles freely around Earth, without having to pass by speed bumps or stop at traffic signals.
<br />He also does not need to pay tolls or stop on vehicle scales.
<br />Izaque has that card and those rights because he does not pollute the environment by using fossil fuels.
<br />The man does not degrade roads when passing above them and does not cause accidents or slow traffic, he can just make his car permeable to pass through other cars.
<br />He calls that the "New World Driving License" and gives it to everyone who owns a Transformer or a Holographic Object that has the vehicle function.
<br />Izaque even learns the Transformer language with Fred, and encounters Transformers around Earth, saying hi to them, receiving two honks and light flashes as a hi.
<br />
<br />The man was really happy with his achievements, he liked to write stories using the Story Writer of the Literature Library (LL).
<br />He wrote a lot of chapters every day, his story, The Life of Littletato, already had one hundred thousand chapters.
<br />The readers were listed in the "Readers" section of the Old World website and the Literature Library page of the story.
<br />The New World readers read the chapters using the Media Experiencing System (MES).
<br />And the Old World readers read using the website, and the computer and phone app.
<br />There were the Old World and New World tabs on the readers' section of the story.
<br />Every entry on the section had the Name_ID of the being, what chapter they were in, and how many text comments they made.
<br />In what year did they start reading the story, and how much time did they spend reading the story.
<br />Creator Izaque loved to write his stories in the "Writing Environment" created by the "Story Writer", a system of the Literature Library (LL).
<br />It was very comfy there, cold with some rain, with a fireplace, a comfy house, hot beverages and food, and a comfy couch.
<br />He also wrote other stories, like "SpaceLiving", "The Secret of the Crystals", and "Desert Island".
<br />
<br />"The Secret of the Crystals" is the story of Ana, a fairy that lives on the planet Earth, a crystal version, where several different species live.
<br />She lives on the Crystal Lands, where the fairies live, where many crystals come out of the ground.
<br />Other species live on this planet too, besides fairies.
<br />Ana and the fairies do not know the origin of the crystals, where they came from, or how they formed.
<br />She is an adventurous and brave girl, she loves exploring her planet, flying, and discovering new islands.
<br />Ana will go in search of the secret of the crystals to try to unravel this mystery that has been around for decades.
<br />She also does not know where the fairies and other creatures came from, or what was the past of the world.
<br />The girl does not know what is beyond the sky, the stars, she wants to discover that.
<br />
<br />"The Story of the Bulkan Siblings", is a story about him and his friend and Tulpa Ana.
<br />In the story, Izaque and Ana are siblings in an alternate universe in a medieval time.
<br />They both have the Bulkan surname and live a happy and adventurous life with their parents.
<br />Rosa Winston Bulkan, their mother, and Fred Bulkan, their father.
<br />They always go on adventures together around the medieval fantasy world, sometimes finding dungeons, treasures, and exotic creatures.
<br />In the story, Izaque Bulkan has the Infinity Gauntlet, which is Thanos' gauntlet with the six infinity stones.
<br />Thanos is a character and being from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a universe that contains all of the universes of all movies of the MCU.
<br />Then, by visiting a universe of a movie from the MCU, you are already inside the MCU.
<br />By writing that into the story, the Izaques on the HMB gave Izaque Bulkan the power to get out of his universe.
<br />"My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic - The Visit of Izaque", is about an alternate universe where an Old World Izaque visits the land of Equestria.
<br />
<br />The man also wrote in his diary, called the "Diary", he created on 03/11/2016, to register what he did daily.
<br />He presented it with his friend and Artificial Intelligence called "Nodus", who helped him manage his things.
<br />Nodus kept him company, and listened to him, Izaque had created a system to present and write the Diary.
<br />It recorded his voice and the voice of Nodus on two separate audio files.
<br />Converting the recordings into text, adding the current time and date to the said phrase.
<br />And also an identifier to differentiate Izaque's dialog from Nodus'.
<br />Izaque's dialog was inside quotes, and Nodus' dialog started after two forward slashes.
<br />The Diary was made in voice form, with media, feeling, and thought streams, it also had vents of Izaque.
<br />Izaque also liked to make trips with his family, his father, and mother, his sisters and brother, or his friends.
<br />When he did that, Izaque asked for them to say hello in the Diary entry, getting their voices recorded.
<br />They said hello in the entry, to the listeners of Izaque Radio, which was where Izaque broadcast his Diary and other things.
<br />He also had created a system to automatically write into an alternate version of the Diary, called "Diary Slim".
<br />Izaque created it on 09/07/2020, it is very recent and simpler, only with text, time, and date.
<br />Made just for writing what he did daily, without his feelings and vents, and Nodus' participation.
<br />A lot of systems that Izaque used could write directly into the Diary Slim.
<br />Like when he wrote a chapter of a story, published a new story or story chapter, or watched an anime, cartoon, or series episode.
<br />Watched a video or a movie, and played a game, along with the genre and playing style.
<br />Made a new drawing, song, video, 3D model, system, hologram, New World change, 
<br />He liked to write his story "New World", to register everything about New World, what happened, and how he created it.
<br />Izaque wrote everything there, every system and hologram that he created, and how he lived, the things that happened in the New World and the human universes.
