		Hello, I am Izaque Sanvezzo, Stake2, and Funkysnipa Cat.<br />
<br />
This is "The Life of Littletato", a story of mine, I created it on August 5, 2017 (05/08/2017).<br />
I created it on the story website called "Wattpad", it was one of my first stories.<br />
It came after my first story, "Desert Island", created on October 23, 2016 (23/10/2016).<br />
I created an account on Wattpad and wanted to test the website, and how it would be to write on it, creating a story called "Littletato".<br />
Which was a mix of "Little" and "Potato", then, I began to write it.<br />
I wrote an entire chapter in one line, with grammatical and typographical errors, with few interesting things.<br />
I still have files of the old chapters to read and see how my writing and storytelling skills have improved.<br />
So, in 2021, I started to revise all the chapters to improve them, I also translated it to Brazilian Portuguese.<br />
And write them in the style of my story "SpaceLiving", with topics and transitions separated by paragraphs.<br />
My story "SpaceLiving" was created on January 19, 2019 (19/01/2019).<br />
I got inspired to start writing stories because of a Brazilian story in the green text format, a writing style that originated on the website 4chan.<br />
The story is called "Year 2035", a name given by me, as it is the first sentence of the story.<br />
Created by "Magno A Lima", on October 7, 2016 (07/10/2016), it is a story of science fiction, survival, fighting, zombies, and superpowers.<br />
It tells the story of Andros, a man who participates in resistance, fighting against a controlling government.<br />
Against zombies, controlling corporations, criminals, and scientific experiments on humans.<br />
The story was so good and interesting, I could feel what the characters were feeling, and imagine the scenes and scenarios.<br />
And I wanted to make people feel and imagine that too, that is why I started writing Littletato.<br />
It has been seven years already, seven years of writing Littletato, this wonderful story, I am writing from 2024.<br />
It is incredible to see how Littletato has evolved a lot over these seven years.<br />
She started as a potato, and a story of a potato in a world of vegetables, like a fable, and a test story.<br />
And she evolved into a girl, a responsible and mature woman, who has her house, work, and a spouse.<br />
She has fun, listens to music, watches things, rides a car, visits places, and goes out with her friends.<br />
I am so happy to know that I already created thirty-three chapters of this story, that makes me so happy :3.<br />
I love this story so much, it helped me create this love and passion for writing and helped me start writing other stories of mine too, like SpaceLiving.<br />
So, thanks for giving my story a try, and I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.<br />
<br />
This story is inspired by:<br />
Slice of life anime, that shows the everyday life of a person.<br />
The anime "Yuru Camp", that shows the lives of girls who like to camp as a pastime and their daily lives.<br />
It is a very relaxing anime about camping, and it has a very relaxing soundtrack too, which I always listen to while writing Littletato.<br />
I would say that the soundtrack of Littletato is the soundtrack of Yuru Camp, and also songs from the folk genre.<br />
Littletato would also like to go camping just like the girls of the anime.<br />
She likes to have relaxing moments like this, on a Saturday morning, after having lunch, spending time with her family or friends, sitting on the sofa.<br />
Watching TV, sitting on area chairs, relaxing, in a park having a picnic, or going on a trip.<br />
This story is also inspired by normal daily life, that I have, and that I see in other places.<br />
For example, in various media, anime, cartoons, series, movies, and videos that show the daily lives of people.<br />
With this story, I have the wish to show the daily life of Littletato, what her life is like, and how incredible it is.<br />
I love this story so much, and I'm happy to write it and to have created it.<br />
<br />
Dates of the chapter:<br />
This chapter was originally written on August 5, 2017, at 23:44.<br />
It was last revised on February 20, 2024, at 01:27.<br />
And it was translated into English on February 24, 2024, at 19:35.<br />
<br />
Littletato was a girl that lived alone, she was always traveling through cities, looking for a good city to live in.<br />
She loved to travel, experience new things, places, and nature, smell new smells, and hear new sounds.<br />
Littletato was nineteen years old in 2019, and was born on February 4, 2000.<br />
The girl had dark brown hair, brown eyes, and white skin, and was vegetarian.<br />
She was born and lived most of her life in Los Angeles, in the state of California, in the United States.<br />
Littletato is bisexual, she discovered herself when she was little, and realized that she also liked girls.<br />
Her parents were Brazilian, they came from Brazil to the United States in search of job opportunities, before having children.<br />
They lived in the city of Maringá, in the state of Paraná, and saved money to travel.<br />
Littletato speaks Brazilian Portuguese and English fluently, but is more used to English.<br />
Her parents taught her Brazilian Portuguese at home since she was little.<br />
While she was traveling, the girl stopped by a city called "San Francisco", in California, in the United States, and started analyzing, the weather, traffic, and people.<br />
She found another girl while walking in San Francisco, it was afternoon, after mid-day, and a little cold.<br />
Her name was Júlia and she was eighteen years old, she was born on Jun 25, 2000.<br />
Júlia had blonde hair, blue eyes, and white skin, and was vegetarian too.<br />
She was homosexual (lesbian), and had also discovered herself when she was little.<br />
Littletato had seen Júlia in a city square, they talked for a while, and Littletato decided to ask Júlia to have a coffee with her.<br />
So they went to the cafeteria and sat at a table outside.<br />
Both asked for a decaf coffee, the order arrived and they started to drink the coffee.<br />
The weather was cold, with wind, and a cloudy sky.<br />
The two girls were wearing winter clothing, very warm and comfortable.<br />
During the talk, they noticed that they had a lot in common.<br />
Júlia also liked to travel, to analyze the weather, people, and scenery of the cities.<br />
"Do you like reading stories?" asked Littletato, who took a sip of her coffee.<br />
"Yes, I love it, what about you Littletato?" asked Júlia, looking at her, while holding her coffee mug.<br />
"Me too, it's so good to meet someone that likes the same things as you right?" asked Littletato, happy.<br />
"I agree, hehe," replied Júlia, smiling, tucking her hair behind her ear.<br />
"Where do you read stories?" asked Littletato, curious.<br />
"I rent books from the city library, and sometimes I read some digital stories on the Wattpad website," replied Júlia.<br />
"Oh, how interesting, me too, I didn't know you used Wattpad too, hehe," said Littletato.<br />
Júlia said she lived alone in a rented house in the city.<br />
Littletato said she was going for a walk around town, got up, and paid the bill for Júlia.<br />
Then Júlia gave her number to Littletato, so they could talk again.<br />
Littletato said that she was a traveler girl and that maybe would not stay in San Francisco, because she was only analyzing the city.<br />
Júlia was a little sad about that, she liked Littletato and found her an interesting girl.<br />
The two said goodbye to each other with a hug, then Littletato walked to a bus stop and waited.<br />
<br />
Littletato got a bus and started walking through the city.<br />
She was thinking about Júlia, about her eyes, her hair, and her gentle voice.<br />
She listened to the music of the Folk genre on her phone, using earbuds, while looking out the bus window, thinking, and reflecting.<br />
Littletato thought she was in love, just thinking about Júlia's voice made her smile.<br />
She was thinking about the city and Júlia, while she looked at the city scenery.<br />
The girl got up and pulled the bus rope, it stopped at a bus stop and the girl got off.<br />
She started walking around the city, with her phone, wallet, money, and other useful things inside her backpack.<br />
The girl remembered that she liked to program sometimes, to make computer programs and applications to help her be more efficient and faster.<br />
Littletato created computer programs in her parent's house when she was a kid, she was fascinated by technology when she was younger.<br />
She thought she would like to work on a programming job, and that it would be fun.<br />
Littletato also had some programming and technology courses in her curriculum to help her get a job.<br />
Then the girl started looking for programming jobs in San Francisco on the Internet.<br />
She found some vacancies and sent her digital resume to several of them, she knew a lot of job websites.<br />
A company accepted her resume and contacted her to give information about the job interview, place, and time.<br />
Littletato ate a delicious dinner at a restaurant, and spent the night in a hotel, paying for accommodation.<br />
She also took pictures of the city of San Francisco, of her dinner, and of the outside of the restaurant.<br />
The girl liked to take pictures of good moments of her life, to keep as memories.<br />
She sent those photos to a WhatsApp group called "Status", and also posted them on her WhatsApp status.<br />
("WhatsApp" is an app that you can install on your smartphone, it lets you chat with people, but you need a phone number and a SIM card to use it.)<br />
<br />
In the morning, she woke up, did her morning needs, and got a bus to the place of the interview.<br />
It was a company called "Interworks Technologies", she entered the building and someone received her.<br />
Then Littletato went through the interview, answering the questions of the interviewer.<br />
After the interview ended, they said they would further review Littletato's resume and give her an answer later this week.<br />
Some time passed, and it was already night, she went back to the hotel, took a shower, had dinner, and waited for thirty minutes.<br />
Littletato then lay down on her bed and took out her phone, it was dark as the light in the bedroom was off.<br />
The girl opened WhatsApp and looked at Júlia's number.<br />
She opened the conversation with Júlia and sent her a message.<br />
"Hey Júlia, it's me, Littletato, I was thinking bout' staying here in San Francisco... It seems to be a good city to live in.<br />
I went through a job interview today, I think I'll get it... I'm very confident in this position."<br />
Júlia replied some minutes later.<br />
"Oh, really?!... I'm so happy because of it :3<br />
Good luck! I hope you get the job Littletato ^^" said Júlia in the message.<br />
"Thanks Júlia, happy because I'm gonna stay? :3" asked Littletato, happy.<br />
"Yes, I think you're cool, and I like you... As a friend...<br />
Do you consider me your friend?" asked Júlia, curious.<br />
"Yes Júlia, and thanks, I think you're cool too ^^<br />
Can I call you Ju?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Hehe, yes you can, and can I call you Tato?" asked Júlia, happy because Littletato would stay in the city.<br />
"Yes you can Ju, hehe," replied Littletato.<br />
"Okay, well, I'm gonna sleep now Tato, good night, sleep tight ^^," said Júlia.<br />
"Good night Ju, see you tomorrow :3," said Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato slept on a peaceful night in San Francisco, very comfortable in her bed.<br />
<br />
When she woke up in the morning, noticed that she had received a message on her phone.<br />
She unlocked her screen to check it, it was from the company that had interviewed her, and she was accepted on the job.<br />
In the message, there was more information about the job, hours, salary, holidays, days off, and other important information.<br />
Littletato was so happy, she was smiling a lot, and sent a message to Júlia to let her know the news.<br />
"Hey Ju, I got the job, they accepted me! :3" said her.<br />
"Really?! That's really great!<br />
I knew you could do it, congrats Tato!" replied Júlia.<br />
"Thanks, hehe," said Littletato.<br />
Littletato then got up, did her morning needs, and got ready for her first day of work.<br />
She would work from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon, and her lunch time would be at noon.<br />
The girl started working at the company, making computer programs and applications.<br />
And also helped her new coworkers, who were starting at the company.<br />
She started living in a rented house.<br />
<br />
Then, three months passed, and Littletato was already used to her new, stable life, in San Francisco.<br />
Her relationship with Júlia continued to grow stronger and stronger, and the two grew closer.<br />
Littletato was in her house, she already worked today, and it was six in the afternoon.<br />
She picked up her phone and opened WhatsApp.<br />
Then she started typing a message to Júlia, that said:<br />
"Hey Ju, I have something to tell you :3<br />
But can I ask you something first?"<br />
"Yes, what's up Tato? :3" asked Júlia.<br />
"Can we meet at that cafeteria where we met for the first time?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay, I'll go prepare myself, when are you going to be there?" asked Júlia.<br />
"At six and a half in the afternoon," replied Littletato.<br />
"Okay, I'll be there, hihi," said Júlia.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato started to get ready to go to the cafeteria, left her house, and took a bus to go there.<br />
They both got there, sat down, and ordered two decaf coffees, just like the first time they'd met.<br />
"So... What do you want to tell me Tato?" asked Júlia, while looking into Littletato's eyes.<br />
"I... I like you, Ju... More than a friend...<br />
You're so gentle with me and helped me a lot.<br />
I think your hair is cute, and your voice too, you're so beautiful..." replied Littletato, a little shy and insecure.<br />
"Hum... Thanks, Tato... I like you too...<br />
I like the fact that I have a lot of things in common with you," said Júlia, smiling, blushing, as she looked at Littletato.<br />
Littletato picked up her chair and sat beside Júlia, she hugged her and said "I love you," and Júlia said the same.<br />
They looked at each other's lips, their heads started to approach and Littletato gave her a peck.<br />
Littletato and Júlia started kissing deeply, hugging tight, feeling happy and in love.<br />
<br />
After some time, Littletato stopped the kiss for shortness of breath.<br />
She looked into Júlia's eyes, in love with her, and happy.<br />
Littletato asked if Júlia wanted to live with her and share the rent.<br />
Júlia said yes, and then she moved into the house where Littletato lived.<br />
Bringing her small things there, and also some furniture.<br />
The house was very good, it had planned furniture and a good bathroom.<br />
Air conditioning, a heater, an electronic garage, and hot water.<br />
Júlia did not work, she said that she had some money stored in her bank account, and she paid her old rent without any problems.<br />
Littletato said that she was going to work to pay her part of the rent and gather money to buy the house.<br />
And also do some investments in fixed and variable income, stock exchange, cryptocurrencies, and other investments.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
A few months had passed, and Littletato had worked hard, gathering money in her bank account, as well as making safe investments.<br />
She managed to buy the house of the owner for her and Júlia to live, without having to pay rent, only paying the energy and water bills and the house taxes.<br />
Then Littletato and Júlia started living there, eating, drinking, cleaning the house, and having fun together.<br />
Júlia said she was very happy, living together with Littletato, her girlfriend.<br />
Littletato arrived home from her job, it was afternoon, already getting dark, she entered the house and locked the front door, saying "I'm home love".<br />
Júlia was sitting on the couch in the living room, watching a series on Netflix, "Welcome back honey," said she.<br />
Littletato sat by her side and hugged her tight, kissing her lips.<br />
Júlia prepared dinner with the help of Littletato, and the two ate while talking a little, after that, they watched something on Netflix for some minutes.<br />
<br />
Then, they went to the bedroom and lay down on the bed, covering themselves with the blanket.<br />
Littletato hugged Júlia tightly from behind and kissed her neck, Júlia shivered and closed her eyes, feeling sleepy.<br />
"I love you, Tato," said Júlia, smiling, and kissed Littletato's hand.<br />
"I love you too, Ju," said Littletato, who sniffed Júlia's hair and closed her eyes.<br />
They slept soundly into the night, waiting for tomorrow, for a new day they would spend together.

This chapter was originally written on August 6, 2017, at 00:17.<br />
It was last revised on March 14, 2024, at 04:12.<br />
And it was translated into English on March 21, 2024, at 00:48.<br />
<br />
It was six o'clock in the afternoon, a Thursday, and Littletato was walking home.<br />
The girl had finished her day of work and was carrying some shopping bags she had packed at the neighborhood supermarket called "Safeway".<br />
In the bags, there were vegetables, fruits, milk, eggs, and two packages of chocolate-stuffed crackers.<br />
Littletato met with a friend that she and Júlia had made during the months they lived together in San Francisco.<br />
They met when Littletato was having a picnic with Júlia in a park on a Sunday.<br />
His friend was a boy named Iam, he was eighteen years old in 2019, and was born on July 16, 2001.<br />
Iam had black hair, dark brown eyes, and white skin, and was straight.<br />
He was born in San Francisco, and worked as a cashier at a local grocery store.<br />
"Hi Iam, good to see you!" said Littletato, smiling at Iam.<br />
Littletato noticed that Iam was also holding shopping bags in his hands.<br />
"It's good to see you too, Tato!" replied Iam while smiling.<br />
"Going shopping too?" asked him, looking at the bags in Littletato's hands, laughing lightly.<br />
"Haha, yes, the vegetables were ending up at home, so I passed by the supermarket.<br />
And I also bought the chocolate stuffed crackers that Júlia loves, and me too, hehe," replied Littletato, laughing lightly.<br />
"Oh, I got it, at home too, I live alone, but my sister is in town, she came to visit me.<br />
So I'm gonna cook for her tonight, and show my culinary skills, hehe.<br />
And I know how it is, haha, I also bought something similar today," said Iam.<br />
"Glad your sister came to visit you," said Littletato smiling, "You must be good at cooking, haha".<br />
"I want to taste your cooking any day, hehe.<br />
What did you buy?" asked Littletato, curious.<br />
"I bought my sister's favorite chocolates, and chocolates for me too", replied Iam, smiling.<br />
"Oh, they must be tasty, haha.<br />
So... I gotta go, or else it will be late for dinner, haha, Júlia must be hungry at home.<br />
Tell your sister that I still want to meet her, hehe," said Littletato, also smiling.<br />
"I also gotta go, my sister must be hungry at home, haha.<br />
Ok, I'll say, we schedule a day, haha.<br />
See you later Tato!" said Iam, smiling.<br />
"See you later Iam!" replied Littletato, smiling too.<br />
Then the two began to walk to their respective houses.<br />
<br />
Littletato arrived home with the shopping, she told Júlia about the conversation she had with Iam.<br />
Júlia also occasionally chatted with Iam on WhatsApp.<br />
Then Littletato left the shopping bags on the kitchen table.<br />
She and Júlia stored their purchases in the kitchen cupboards and the fridge.<br />
Then the two girls started preparing dinner.<br />
Littletato made rice seasoned with salt, garlic, onion, and chopped carrots.<br />
She also cooked beans well seasoned with salt, garlic, onion, black pepper, and bay leaf.<br />
The smell of the rice and beans was wonderful.<br />
Júlia made two scrambled eggs fried with salt, parsley, oregano, and chopped mozzarella cheese.<br />
The girl also made cooked potatoes and carrots with salt, onion, and parsley, and orange juice with ice cubes.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_salmon border_radius_6_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/The Life of Littletato/Chapters/02/Images/Dinner.png" style="max-width: 60%;" /><br /><br />
Then they prepared the table to eat, placing all the pans with food, plates, cutlery, and glasses.<br />
Littletato and Júlia began to eat the delicious dinner they had prepared together, while talking.<br />
"The food is very tasty today love, the scrambled egg you made is delicious!<br />
And the boiled potatoes and carrots too," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Thank you love, it's truly very tasty, the beans you made were wonderful!" said Júlia, smiling.<br />
"You're welcome, and thank you love," said Littletato, who continued eating.<br />
"How was work today love?" asked Júlia, curious.<br />
"Oh, today was cool, I met my new coworker, her desk is next to mine.<br />
It's Mia, I helped her with a problem in the code she was programming, which was giving an error.<br />
We tried to find the error for almost an hour...<br />
Until we discovered that it was a semicolon that wasn't placed, haha," explained Littletato, laughing lightly.<br />
(Mia was twenty years old in 2019, and was born on November 19, 1999.<br />
She had black hair, dark brown eyes, and white skin, and was straight.)<br />
"I think we were a little stressed about work..." said Littletato, with a tired look, her head down.<br />
"Oh, I understand love, how cool that you met your new coworker today," said Júlia, smiling slightly.<br />
"I'm sorry you were stressed at work...<br />
It must be tiring right?" asked Júlia, with a look of concern.<br />
"Yes, it's mentally tiring love... A lot to think about, the code and everything..." replied Littletato, with a sad look.<br />
"I guess I just need to get a good night's sleep," said Littletato, with a slight smile.<br />
"Alright love, let's go to sleep tightly after dinner, maybe that helps, hehe," said Júlia, smiling.<br />
"It does help love, thank you," said Littletato, smiling back.<br />
Then Littletato and Júlia finished eating, they organized the dishes in the sink to be washed tomorrow, and soaked plates in water.<br />
The girls went to watch an episode of their favorite series on Netflix, the series "The Walking Dead", to rest their bellies.<br />
(Netflix is a website and phone and TV app where you can watch series, movies, cartoons, and anime online, using a paid plan.)<br />
("The Walking Dead" is a North American dramatic and post-apocalypse television series, developed by Frank Darabont, and based on the same name comic series with Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard.<br />
The series premiered on October 31, 2010.<br />
"The Walking Dead" tells the story of a small group of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world full of the undead.<br />
The series presents the excessive journey of the group led by Rick Grimes, in search of supplies and safe havens.<br />
Furthermore, survivors have to deal with moral dilemmas, confused feelings, and everyday challenges in a hostile world practically dominated by the undead.)<br />
They finished watching the episode, went to the bedroom, and lay down together, sleeping covered in the cold night.<br />
<br />
The other day, a Friday, Littletato had woken up, but Júlia was still sleeping.<br />
The girl looked at the digital clock on the wall and saw that it was seven hours and thirty minutes in the morning.<br />
Littletato got up from the bed, stretching.<br />
Then she walked to the bathroom and did her morning needs.<br />
After that, she walked to the kitchen and started making breakfast for her and Júlia.<br />
The girl took two china mugs from the cupboard.<br />
She put milk and chocolate powder in both, mixing the two ingredients with a spoon.<br />
Then she took two white china plates and placed two slices of wholemeal bread on each one.<br />
Littletato took a knife and butter, buttering a slice of bread on each plate.<br />
After that, the girl took the bowl of ricotta cheese from the fridge and placed a slice of cheese on each sandwich.<br />
Then the girl made two fried scrambled eggs, as well seasoned and delicious as the ones from yesterday's dinner.<br />
Littletato placed a scrambled egg on each sandwich, closing them both.<br />
<br />
The girl returned to the bedroom, waking up Júlia with a kiss, and caressing her.<br />
"Good morning my love," said Littletato to Júlia, smiling.<br />
"Good morning love," said Júlia, returning the kiss, and then stretching.<br />
Júlia walked to the bathroom and did her morning needs.<br />
After that, she and Littletato went to the kitchen and started to eat breakfast.<br />
"Thank you for making breakfast for me love, it's very delicious," said Júlia, smiling.<br />
"You're welcome love, I love spoiling you, hihi," said Littletato, also smiling.<br />
"You still have a few hours before going to work right honey?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yes, why honey?" asked Littletato.<br />
"It's because I miss you when you go to work honey..." replied Júlia, with a sad look, pouting.<br />
"Oh my love..." said Littletato, smiling at Júlia's cuteness.<br />
Then Littletato sat next to Júlia, hugging her tightly, and kissing her on the lips.<br />
"It's okay honey, when I get back from work, I'll be all yours okay?" asked Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Okay love, hehe, I love you my little potato," said Júlia, smiling, kissing Littletato.<br />
"I love you too my little potato," replied Littletato, also smiling, and returning the kiss.<br />
Then Littletato and Júlia continued eating their sandwiches and drinking their chocolate drinks.<br />
<br />
The two lovers finished eating breakfast.<br />
Júlia washed the dishes they used and the dishes from yesterday's dinner.<br />
Littletato and Júlia's house had a computer room.<br />
In this room, Littletato's gaming computer and Júlia's gaming laptop were located.<br />
There were two very comfortable gamer chairs, with head support.<br />
And two very beautiful laminated wood tables, one against the other.<br />
Both tables had drawers to store computer stuff, like mice, keyboards, and headphones.<br />
On Littletato's desk, there was the computer monitor, the speakers, the headset, and its support.<br />
There was also a large keyboard drawer, where the keyboard and mouse lived, and a large mouse pad was underneath both.<br />
The computer of Littletato had RGB lights on several parts, including the keyboard, mouse, headset, and speakers as well.<br />
Littletato had chosen hot pink for the RGB lights on her computer and peripherals.<br />
Her headphones were also pink, Littletato thought that color looked very beautiful on her electronics.<br />
Littletato liked playing games on her computer a lot, on the gaming platform called "Steam".<br />
(Steam is a free and paid game distribution platform, where you can buy and download games to your computer.)<br />
The girl liked to play the games "Counter-Strike 1.6", "Counter-Strike: Source", and "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)".<br />
They are all FPS ("First Person Shooter") games.<br />
Júlia's laptop was a gamer one and pink too, she liked it a lot, it also had a gamer mouse.<br />
She used it to chat with her friends on social media, in addition to her phone.<br />
She also used it to make drawings in the digital drawing program called "Paint Tool SAI".<br />
And also play games on Steam along with Littletato, and also with her friends.<br />
Júlia also had a headset as good as Littletato's, with support too.<br />
Littletato's computer and Júlia's laptop were very powerful, some of the best of 2019.<br />
<br />
Júlia walked to the bedroom and put on a red hoodie, was a little cold in the morning.<br />
Littletato had increased the air conditioning temperature to be less cold.<br />
She went to the computer room with Júlia, both sat in their respective gamer chairs.<br />
Littletato turned on her computer, opened Steam, and left some games updating.<br />
Then she opened the "Mozilla Firefox" browser, opened some social networks, and started talking with her friends.<br />
She also put an electronic song to play on the "SoundCloud" website, listening in her headphones.<br />
Júlia turned on her laptop, waited for it to start, and did the same.<br />
She talked a little with her friends on Facebook, including Iam.<br />
(Facebook is a social network where you can talk with many people and have a social profile.<br />
Many people use it only to talk and keep in touch with their family.)<br />
After a while talking with her friends, Júlia closed the browser.<br />
Júlia opened a game called "Counter-Strike 1.6" on her Steam to play.<br />
It was a FPS ("First Person Shooter") game, where you needed to complete a goal.<br />
There were two teams, the Terrorists, and the Counter-Terrorists, the terrorists had to plant a bomb.<br />
And the counter-terrorists had to disarm it.<br />
Both teams also could win by eliminating the entire enemy team.<br />
It was an online multiplayer game, with other players.<br />
Júlia started playing the game, joining a server, and playing on the terrorists' team.<br />
Littletato was on Facebook, talking with her friends.<br />
Even if these friends were just digital friends, she was happy to have them.<br />
Her friends shared news and memes in timeline posts, and Littletato was looking at some.<br />
One piece of news caught her attention, it was a story showing the situation of homeless people in New York.<br />
Littletato was sad to read that article, seeing the homeless people suffering from hunger and the absence of shelter.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato closed the story and began to roll her Facebook timeline again.<br />
Her friend Iam had sent her a message on Messenger, the Facebook messaging and chat section.<br />
She clicked on the message to see what it was.<br />
"Hi Tato, how's it going?" asked Iam in his message.<br />
"Hi, I'm good, and you Iam?<br />
Awake this early? xD" replied Littletato.<br />
"Yeah xD, I'm playing a little before going to work<br />
How are things going for you and Júlia?" asked Iam, curious.<br />
"They're good, I work, Júlia takes care of the house, and cooks, I also help her with the house things<br />
And we don't pay rent, I managed to raise money and bought the house<br />
And with you, how are things going Iam?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Good, I'm happy for you, it seems to be a busy routine, but cool xD<br />
And it's good that you managed to buy the house<br />
I'm also working and gathering money in the bank to buy one<br />
Things are going well with me, thanks for asking xD" replied Iam.<br />
"Thank you, and how interesting xD<br />
Good luck in gathering money Iam!" said Littletato with a smile emoji.<br />
"Thanks Tato, good luck at work xD<br />
I wish you and Júlia a lot of happiness 😊<br />
You are a very cute couple xD" said Iam.<br />
"You're welcome, thanks Iam 😊<br />
I'm happy you think this, hehe, and Júlia is also<br />
And you, have a girlfriend?" asked Littletato, curious.<br />
"I don't have, I'm single, hehe, I'm focusing more on work<br />
And in finishing my college," replied Iam.<br />
<br />
"Oh, that's interesting, what course are you taking?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I do mechanic engineering, it's very fun I think xD" replied Iam.<br />
"Very good, haha, good luck!<br />
How was dinner with your sister yesterday? xD" asked Littletato.<br />
"Thank you xD<br />
Oh, it was good, I had dinner with her, and she liked my food xD<br />
And we talked a lot, caught up, and remembered good times from our childhood<br />
We played a little on my Xbox One and watched a series on Netflix<br />
Then she left by car, back to her city<br />
I gave her leftovers from dinner and a cake I had made for her to take home xD<br />
It was very good to see my sister again, she's very fun xD" replied Iam.<br />
"Oh, how cool, very interesting xD<br />
It must have been very fun, I'm happy for you Iam," said Littletato.<br />
"Yes, hehe, so... I'm going to go out and play some more, ok?<br />
See you later Tato! 😊" said Iam.<br />
"Alright then xD, see you later Iam 😊" said Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato closed the social networks and the music website.<br />
She opened the game "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)" on Steam, in the "Warzone" mode, to play.<br />
The "Warzone" mode was a "Battle royale" mode.<br />
A "Battle royale" game mode is an online multiplayer game mode.<br />
This mode combines last-man-standing gameplay with the survival, exploration, and resource-gathering elements of a survival game.<br />
Battle royale games involve dozens to hundreds of players, who start with minimal equipment.<br />
And then must eliminate all other opponents, collecting resources and weaponry on the battlefield.<br />
While avoiding being trapped outside a shrinking "safe area", with the winner being the last player or team alive.<br />
<br />
After playing a few matches of the game, it was eight and a half in the morning.<br />
Littletato closed the game and turned her computer off, getting up.<br />
Júlia had already finished her matches of "Counter-Strike 1.6".<br />
"Hey love, I'm gonna go to work okay?" asked Littletato, next to Júlia.<br />
Then Júlia got up from the chair and hugged Littletato tightly.<br />
"Ok love, good luck at work, good job.<br />
I love you honey," replied Júlia, smiling at Littletato, and kissing her.<br />
"Thanks my love, I love you too honey," said Littletato, smiling and returning the kiss.<br />
Then Littletato went to the bedroom, taking her phone and headphones, and putting them inside her backpack.<br />
The girl was also carrying her wallet and phone charger inside it.<br />
Littletato and Júlia had a bicycle each in their house.<br />
Then Littletato opened the exit door of the house with the key, leaving with the bicycle.<br />
The girl left the house, saying goodbye to Júlia, and she said goodbye back.<br />
Littletato got on the bicycle and started pedaling to work.<br />
<br />
Júlia entered the house again, locking the door, and returning to the laptop.<br />
The girl had a diary on her laptop, organized by year and month folders.<br />
And text files were created for each day in her life.<br />
Júlia wrote what happened yesterday in yesterday's file, and did the same for today's text file.<br />
Then Júlia turned off her laptop and left her large headset in its support.<br />
The girl got her phone, which had eighty-five percent battery power.<br />
And got her small headphones in the drawer of her desk.<br />
Júlia then got ready to go to the gym, which Littletato paid for each month for the two of them.<br />
The girl stored her exercise clothes inside her backpack.<br />
Júlia filled her water bottle and stored it too, putting the backpack on her back.<br />
Then Júlia got her bicycle and left the house, locking the door.<br />
The girl got the house key, and Littletato had a spare.<br />
Júlia then cycled to the gym, it was a bit far, so she could do some exercise on the way.<br />
She was cycling and listening to low music on her phone.<br />
The phone was attached to a phone armband on her arm.<br />
The girl got there and started doing the exercises that were in her exercise guide.<br />
<br />
It was ten and a half in the morning, and Littletato had already arrived at work on her bicycle.<br />
The girl had already worked a little, and finished the visual part of an app.<br />
The company Littletato worked for was making this app for another company.<br />
Then Littletato worked for a few more hours, programming the same app, and helping her colleagues.<br />
It was already midday, and Littletato had an hour for lunch.<br />
The girl could leave work to eat somewhere or take a packed lunch.<br />
Then Littletato left work with her backpack, which had her phone, charger, headphones, and wallet.<br />
She went to a restaurant called "Mersea Restaurant & Bar", which seemed to serve delicious food.<br />
The girl ordered a double-stacked cheeseburger, with a vegan hamburger made from lentils, and cheddar cheese.<br />
The cheeseburger also had ketchup, mayonnaise, and iceberg lettuce, and the bun was a brioche bun.<br />
She also ordered a can of Coca-Cola to drink with her cheeseburger.<br />
Then the order arrived, and she flavored her cheeseburger while drinking her soda.<br />
After a few minutes, Littletato finished eating, she went to the cashier and paid for her order.<br />
The total order was nineteen dollars (ninety-four reals in 2024).<br />
Then the girl returned to the company where she worked and continued her work.<br />
Júlia was already home, she had already finished her two hours of exercise at the gym.<br />
She had made a delicious lunch for her to eat and she had already eaten it, it was very good.<br />
The girl was playing a little of the game called "The Sims 4" on her laptop.<br />
<br />
After some hours of work, it was five in the afternoon.<br />
Littletato picked up her backpack and started walking back home.<br />
The girl arrived home and opened the door with her spare key, locking it from the inside.<br />
Júlia was watching a live stream of the game "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)" on YouTube.<br />
And was eating a package of chocolate-stuffed cookies.<br />
Littletato walked to the computer room, kissing Júlia on the lips.<br />
"Welcome back love," said Júlia, smiling at her, and returning the kiss.<br />
"Thanks love," replied Littletato, who walked to the bedroom and changed, putting on pajamas<br />
Then Littletato and Júlia made dinner together, they ate while talking about how each other's day was.<br />
Júlia talked about her training session today at the gym, and Littletato talked about how it was at work.<br />
After eating, they both walked to the computer room and turned on their computers.<br />
Littletato and Júlia played a few matches of the game "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)" in "Warzone" mode.<br />
The girls enjoyed playing together, on the same team, and surviving together, winning several matches.<br />
The couple was a little tired, they turned off their computers, and Júlia left her laptop charging.<br />
It was eleven at night, Littletato took Júlia in her arms and walked to the bedroom.<br />
She placed Júlia on the bed, lying down with her.<br />
The girls covered themselves with the blanket and hugged each other tightly.<br />
Littletato kissed Júlia on the lips, smiling.<br />
"Good night my love, sleep well, I love you honey," said Littletato.<br />
Júlia returned the kiss and smiled back, "Good night love, sleep well too, I love you too honey," replied her.<br />
Then the girls slept together in the cold night, waiting for another day.

This chapter was originally written on August 28, 2017, at 05:00.<br />
It was last revised on April 8, 2024, at 00:16.<br />
And it was translated into English on April 20, 2024, at 19:51.<br />
<br />
It was seven thirty minutes in the morning, a Saturday, and Littletato did not have to work today.<br />
Littletato woke up and looked at the sun shining through the window.<br />
She woke up Júlia with a kiss on her lips, "Good morning my love," said her.<br />
"Good morning honey," replied Júlia, returning the kiss, and hugging her.<br />
Then they both got up from the bed and did their morning needs.<br />
Júlia and Littletato washed their faces, brushed their teeth, and combed their hair.<br />
After that, the girls went to the kitchen.<br />
They drank some water from their bottles before starting their day.<br />
Then they started to prepare their breakfast.<br />
Júlia prepared two mugs of milk with cappuccino powder and brown sugar for her and Littletato.<br />
Littletato prepared two sandwiches with ricotta cheese and mustard.<br />
On Thursday, she and Júlia had made lentil burgers well-seasoned with onion, parsley, salt, and oregano.<br />
They froze the burgers so they could use them in dishes later.<br />
Then Littletato took two burgers out of the freezer compartment of the fridge.<br />
She fried them with olive oil in a non-stick frying pan.<br />
After that, Littletato added the burgers to the sandwiches, closing them.<br />
Littletato and Júlia ate their sandwiches and drank their cappuccinos while they talked.<br />
The breakfast was delicious, and Júlia loved eating with Littletato.<br />
"The burger we made on Thursday is very delicious love," said Júlia, smiling at Littletato.<br />
"Yes, it's very good honey, and I loved the cappuccino you made," said Littletato, smiling too.<br />
"Thank you love, I'm glad you loved it," said Júlia, happy.<br />
<br />
Then the couple finished eating breakfast, Littletato washed the dishes and Júlia put them away.<br />
After that, the girls sat on the sofa to rest their bellies, playing on their phones.<br />
"Hey honey, I'm thinking about having a picnic today in the park, what do you think?" asked Littletato, looking at Júlia.<br />
"I think it's a good idea honey, Saturdays are always good for picnics, hehe.<br />
I'm going to invite Iam too, okay?" asked Júlia, happy with Littletato's idea.<br />
"Okay, you can invite him honey.<br />
The picnic will be at nine, okay?" asked Littletato, scrolling through her phone.<br />
"Alright honey, I'll let him know," replied Júlia.<br />
"Hey Iam, Littletato and I are going to have a picnic at the park today at nine in the morning<br />
Do you wanna come? 😊" asked Júlia in a message to Iam on WhatsApp.<br />
After a few minutes, Iam replied to her message.<br />
"Heey Júlia, yes I want to, I think it's gonna be very fun!<br />
I'll bring some food too 😊" replied Iam in his message.<br />
"Okay, thank you 😊" said Júlia in another message.<br />
Littletato and Júlia had a shared item and task list app.<br />
Like shopping or homework lists.<br />
Littletato and Júlia wrote down the things that they were going to bring on a list of items in the app.<br />
Then the girls divided the list into two, to make it easier to prepare everything.<br />
Littletato would buy snacks, and make a delicious vegetable pie.<br />
Júlia would buy some sweets and make a chocolate cake.<br />
After listing everything they would need, they both left the house with their bicycles, locking the door.<br />
They went to the "Safeway" supermarket together, and bought everything on their shopping list.<br />
<br />
After that, they both returned home and put away their shopping.<br />
Littletato had bought a picnic basket with a cooler bag.<br />
Júlia started preparing the chocolate-filled cake, she was good at baking cakes.<br />
Littletato made a pitcher of orange juice with brown sugar.<br />
She put the plastic jug and bag of biodegradable cups in the picnic basket.<br />
The girl also put the Doritos and Cheetos snacks and the sweets and chocolates that Júlia had bought.<br />
Then Littletato prepared a vegetable pie well seasoned with salt, black pepper, and oregano.<br />
She left the pie baking along with Júlia's chocolate cake.<br />
After a few minutes, both recipes were ready.<br />
The girls took the recipes from the oven, cutting each one into small pieces.<br />
Then they took two large basins to store the food.<br />
Littletato put the pieces of her vegetable pie in a basin.<br />
And Júlia put the pieces of her chocolate cake in another.<br />
Littletato also put the picnic blanket and biodegradable napkins.<br />
She also stored sunscreen, repellent, and biodegradable cutlery and garbage bags.<br />
The girls also prepared their backpacks, storing their phones, headphones, and water bottles.<br />
After preparing everything for the picnic, it was eight and forty-five in the morning.<br />
Júlia sent a message to Iam telling him that they were leaving home.<br />
Littletato and Júlia put their backpacks on their backs and left home with their bikes.<br />
Then Littletato locked the door, she would bring the picnic basket with her on the bike.<br />
Both began to pedal to the park with their bicycles.<br />
They were happy to be riding a bike together.<br />
And they were listening to a low and fun song of the "Folk" genre in their headphones, on the "YouTube Music" app.<br />
<br />
After walking a little, the girls arrived at the neighborhood park.<br />
They locked their bicycles to a park fence with bike locks.<br />
Then Littletato spread the picnic blanket on the grass.<br />
She prepared all the picnic items, placing them on the towel.<br />
Iam arrived on his bike a few minutes later, locking it in the fence.<br />
"Hii guys, I'm here," said Iam, looking at the girls.<br />
"Hello Iam, make yourself comfortable," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Hii Iam," said Júlia, smiling too.<br />
Then they sat down on the picnic blanket, getting comfortable.<br />
The three friends started eating the seasoned vegetable pie while drinking orange juice.<br />
Júlia had served the juice for everyone, and Littletato served the vegetable pie.<br />
"Wow, this pie is delicious Tato," said Iam, smiling.<br />
"Thanks Iam, I did it with a lot of love," replied Littletato, smiling too.<br />
They ate a few more pieces of vegetable pie and left some juice to drink with the cake.<br />
Then Júlia served the chocolate cake for Littletato and Iam.<br />
"This chocolate cake is delicious love, I loved the topping," said Littletato, with her mouth covered in chocolate, looking at Júlia.<br />
"It is, hehe," said Iam, smiling.<br />
"Thanks you all, I'm happy you liked it, hihi," said Júlia, smiling.<br />
Then they ate a few more pieces of the chocolate cake while they drank the orange juice.<br />
"Hey people, I brought something for us to eat too..." said Iam, who took a bowl out of a bag.<br />
Iam had brought Coxinhas with jackfruit meat prepared by himself.<br />
He was not vegetarian like Littletato and Júlia, but he did not bring meat Coxinhas in respect to them.<br />
"Wow, what is the stuffing?" asked Littletato, curious.<br />
"It is jackfruit meat, it's very good, want to prove it?" asked Iam, laughing lightly.<br />
"Yes, they look very delicious", replied Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato, Júlia, and Iam ate the Coxinhas with jackfruit meat stuffing and found them delicious.<br />
<br />
After eating the vegetable pie, the chocolate cake, and the Coxinhas, the friends ate the snacks, sweets, and chocolates as well.<br />
As they drank the rest of the orange juice that Littletato had made and talked.<br />
They also drank water when they were thirsty.<br />
The friends took various pictures and selfies together, and also from the picnic and the food.<br />
And they posted them on WhatsApp status for their family and friends to see.<br />
It was mid-day, and Littletato, Júlia, and Iam began to dismantle the picnic.<br />
Collecting all the trash, and storing the things in the picnic basket.<br />
Littletato and Júlia had divided the pieces left over from the vegetable pie and the chocolate cake between them and Iam.<br />
Iam was happy to be able to take pieces of the pie and the cake home, he liked it a lot.<br />
"You can give us back the basins later, hehe," said Littletato, laughing a little at Iam.<br />
"Alright, I'll return them, hehe," replied Iam.<br />
The picnic was already dismantled, the garbage collected, and the utensils were in the picnic basket.<br />
"This picnic was very good people, thanks for inviting me," said Iam, smiling at the couple.<br />
"You're welcome, it was really fun hihi, I'm happy you liked it," said Júlia, smiling too.<br />
"It's true, thanks for coming Iam, we should do it more often, hehe," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
Iam hugged Littletato and Júlia, happy to have spent this time with them.<br />
"See you later girls!" said Iam, smiling, "See ya!" said Littletato and Júlia, smiling too.<br />
Then the three friends climbed onto their bicycles and began to pedal to their homes.<br />
After a few minutes, the girls got home, unlocked the door, and stored their bicycles.<br />
Littletato removed the things from the picnic basket, leaving the garbage bag in the dumpsters outside the house.<br />
Then she put the picnic towel in a kitchen cabinet drawer.<br />
She stored the bowls with the pieces of pie and cake in the fridge, for her and Júlia to eat later.<br />
Then she washed the plastic pitcher where they drank the juice, and put it on the kitchen cabinet.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Júlia went to the living room and sat on the couch.<br />
They started fiddling with their phones, and Littletato was looking at the photos they had taken at the picnic, on WhatsApp.<br />
The girl enjoyed having the picnic with Júlia and Iam, she was very happy.<br />
Then she created a group with the two on WhatsApp and sent the photos there.<br />
Júlia was talking with her sister Vitória on WhatsApp.<br />
Vitória was nineteen years old in 2019, and was born on April 12, 2000.<br />
She had brown hair, dark brown eyes, and white skin, and was straight.<br />
The girl lived in the state of New York, in the capital of the same name.<br />
Júlia also had a brother called Rogério, the three grew up together in their parents' house.<br />
"Hii sis, how are things in New York?" asked Júlia to Vitória in a message on WhatsApp.<br />
"Hii little sis, ah, actually I'm in San Francisco, I arrived a few minutes ago xD<br />
I'm traveling through the city with my husband, he came to visit his sister<br />
And I came to visit you, hehe 😊, are you home?" asked Vitória in a message.<br />
"Ah, I get it, yes, I am sis," replied Júlia in her message.<br />
"Hey love, Vitória is in town and wants to stop by, is that okay with you?" asked Júlia.<br />
"It's okay love, hihi, I'd love to meet your sister in person," replied Littletato smiling.<br />
Littletato heard Júlia talk about her sister Vitória, but she had never talked with her.<br />
"You can come here sis, Littletato wants to meet you, hihi 😊" said Júlia in her message to Vitória.<br />
Then Júlia sent the location of her and Littletato's house to Vitória.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Vitória arrived at the house, her husband was driving.<br />
She got out of the car and rang the doorbell, Littletato and Júlia opened the door and greeted her.<br />
Vitória hugged Júlia tightly, saying "I missed you so much little sis!" while smiling.<br />
"I missed you too sis," replied Júlia, hugging her back, and smiling too.<br />
Vitória then broke the hug and looked at Littletato.<br />
"So you're the one who's Júlia's wife, Littletato? hehe," asked Vitória.<br />
"Yes, it's me, nice to meet you Vitória!" replied Littletato smiling, hugging Vitória.<br />
"Nice to meet you too, hihi," said Vitória, smiling too.<br />
Then the three girls walked to the car, looking at Vitória's husband.<br />
His name was Lucas, he was twenty-one years old in 2019, and was born on July 17, 1998.<br />
The boy had light brown hair, dark brown eyes, and white skin, and was straight.<br />
"Hii Lucas, how are you?" asked Júlia to Lucas, smiling.<br />
"Hii, yes, I'm good, what about you Júlia?" asked Lucas, smiling too.<br />
"Also, that's good, hihi.<br />
Hey love, this is my brother-in-law Lucas, Vitória's husband.<br />
And this is my wife, Littletato," replied Júlia.<br />
"Nice to meet you Lucas," said Littletato, shaking Lucas' hand.<br />
"The pleasure is all mine Littletato, hehe," replied Lucas, smiling.<br />
"So... I just came here to meet you and leave Vitória.<br />
I'm going to my sister's house to visit her, hihi.<br />
Message me whenever you want me to pick you up, ok love?" asked Lucas to Vitória.<br />
"Ok love, I'll send it," replied Vitória.<br />
"See you people!" said Lucas, smiling.<br />
"See ya!" said the girls, smiling back, waving their hands.<br />
Then Lucas started the car and started driving to his sister's house.<br />
<br />
After that, the three girls entered Littletato and Júlia's house.<br />
The couple showed the rooms of their house to Vitória.<br />
"So this is your house little sis..." said Vitória, analyzing Júlia and Littletato's house.<br />
"Yes, it's a very beautiful and very comfortable house sis.<br />
Tato and I love living here," replied Júlia, hugging Littletato's arm, smiling.<br />
"Yes, it's truly very beautiful little sis," said Vitória, looking at the two, smiling too.<br />
It was midday and forty, and Littletato and Júlia were already hungry.<br />
"Hey Vitória, want to have lunch with us?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Ah, yes, if it's not too much trouble, hihi.<br />
I only had a snack and a soft drink downtown with Lucas, before we came here.<br />
But that has been some good minutes ago," replied Vitória.<br />
"It's no trouble sis, it's alright, hihi, we're happy to have you here.<br />
Right love?" asked Júlia, smiling at Vitória, and then looking at Littletato.<br />
"Yes love, it's good to have you here with us, dear little sister-in-law, hehe," replied Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Thanks, you all, I'm also happy to be here with you, hihi," said Vitória, smiling.<br />
Then the three girls walked to the kitchen, Littletato got the bowl with the pieces of vegetable pie.<br />
She opened it and put it in the microwave to heat it.<br />
Vitória started making some grape juice with brown sugar for lunch.<br />
And Júlia began to set the table for lunch, placing the plates, cutlery, and glasses.<br />
Littletato also heated the rice and beans that were already made in the fridge.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, the food was ready.<br />
The three girls began to eat rice, beans, vegetable pie, and drink grape juice.<br />
"Wow, this pie is delicious, who made it?" asked Vitória, smiling.<br />
"It was me sis, I'm happy you liked it, hihi.<br />
I made it for me, Littletato, and for our friend Iam to eat at a picnic we had earlier today.<br />
Then we saved what was left to eat later," replied Júlia, smiling.<br />
"I see, hihi, it must have been fun," said Vitória.<br />
"Hey Vitória, what do you work with?" asked Littletato, curious.<br />
"Ah, I work as a freelance designer.<br />
And I do design work like logos, banners, store facades, and stuff like that.<br />
I earn for work done, you know, and not a fixed salary.<br />
It needs a lot of marketing on my part, for customers to find me, but it's worth it, hehe," replied Vitória.<br />
"I see, this is very interesting, hehe.<br />
I work as a programmer at the company Interworks Technologies.<br />
Making apps, computer programs, and websites, it's pretty fun, hehe," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"It must be cool, hehe, I would like to learn how to create apps and programs, and programming in general.<br />
I think that would help a lot with my productivity as a designer, on the computer.<br />
I even brought my laptop here so I could work later, hehe," said Vitória.<br />
"Ah, maybe I'll teach you how to program someday, hehe.<br />
And you can teach me design concepts," said Littletato.<br />
"Tato is getting along well with my sister, I'm happy, hehe," thought Júlia in her mind, watching at the two talk.<br />
"I also want to learn design with you sis," said Júlia, smiling.<br />
"Alright, I'll teach you two, hehe.<br />
And I'll be happy to learn how to program with you Littletato, hihi," said Vitória, smiling too.<br />
"And you, do you work little sis?" asked Vitória to Júlia.<br />
"Ah, not yet sis, I'm at home more, cleaning the house.<br />
Organizing things, shopping, and having fun too.<br />
But I want to get a job very soon, hihi," replied Júlia.<br />
"I see, that's cool, hihi, good luck little sis," said Vitória, smiling.<br />
"Thanks sis," said Júlia, smiling too.<br />
<br />
After eating, drinking juice, and talking a little, the girls finished eating lunch.<br />
Littletato cleaned and organized the table, Vitória washed the lunch dishes, and Júlia helped her by putting away the dishes.<br />
It was one and thirty in the afternoon, and the three girls went to the living room.<br />
They sat on the couch to rest their bellies, and Littletato turned on the television.<br />
Littletato and Júlia had a video game called "Xbox One" in their living room.<br />
They had two custom Xbox controllers, painted in light pink.<br />
And they also had two more green spare controllers, so that friends could play too.<br />
"Hey Vitória, want to play some Xbox with us?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Ah, of course, I like playing games a lot in my free time.<br />
I play on Lucas' Xbox, and also on the PC I have at home," replied Vitória.<br />
Then Littletato took the two pink controllers and gave one to Júlia.<br />
After that, she took a green controller and gave it to Vitória.<br />
Littletato put the game "Overcooked! 2" on for them to play.<br />
("Overcooked! 2" is a cooperative cooking simulation video game developed by Ghost Town Games and published by Team17, a sequel to "Overcooked!".<br />
It was released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on August 7, 2018.<br />
In Overcooked 2, teams of up to four players cooperatively prepare and cook orders in absurd restaurants.<br />
Players collect, chop, and cook ingredients, combine them into dishes, serve meals, and wash dishes.<br />
Between coordinating orders and hitting other players' characters, the game tends to become chaotic.)<br />
Then the girls played the cooperative cooking game for a few minutes.<br />
And then they played other games together and had a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
After a few hours, Vitória sent a message to her husband Lucas to come and pick her up.<br />
She said goodbye to Littletato and Júlia, happy to have visited her sister after not seeing her for so long.<br />
And happy to have met his sister Júlia's wife.<br />
Vitória left with Lucas, back to New York.<br />
After a few minutes, it was dinner time, and Littletato and Júlia prepared dinner together.<br />
Then they had dinner, and after that, they rested their bellies while watching the series "The Walking Dead" on Netflix.<br />
After that, they went to the bedroom and lay down on the bed, covering themselves.<br />
The girls said "I love you" to each other, wishing them a good night, and kissing each other.<br />
They were tired after a long day, with the picnic, and the visit from Júlia's sister, Vitória.<br />
And they were also happy for this so special day, then they slept in the starry night.

		Dates of the chapter:<br />
This chapter was originally written on September 15, 2017, at 19:23.<br />
It was last revised on May 3, 2024, at 20:42.<br />
And it was translated into English on June 19, 2024, at 18:04.<br />
<br />
It was a Tuesday, January 21, 2020, at six and a half in the morning.<br />
Littletato was lying on her bed, looking at the sun shining through the bedroom window, Júlia was still sleeping.<br />
The girl was thinking about the moments she spent in her parent's house on New Year's.<br />
Her parents' house was in her hometown, Los Angeles, in the state of California, in the United States.<br />
Ana, Littletato's mother, was forty years old in 2020, and was born on July 22, 1980.<br />
She had blonde hair, green eyes, and white skin, and was straight.<br />
Littletato's father, John, was forty-three years old in 2020, and was born on March 15, 1977.<br />
He had brown hair, dark brown eyes, and white skin, and was straight.<br />
Both of Littletato's parents were retired, and lived in their house in Los Angeles.<br />
Carol, Littletato's younger sister, was also there for New Year's, visiting her parents.<br />
She lived in Los Angeles, so her parents' house was close by.<br />
The girl was nineteen years old in 2020, and was born on May 17, 2001.<br />
Littletato also had a brother and a sister, but they were missing, and she missed them.<br />
They disappeared when they were little, and Littletato's parents did not know their whereabouts.<br />
The disappearance case was closed by the local police due to a lack of evidence and clues as to the siblings' whereabouts.<br />
Littletato liked to play with them and Carol a lot when they were children.<br />
But over time, she forgot their names, only remembering their faces.<br />
Littletato had two months of vacation per year, one in January, and one in December.<br />
The company "Interworks Technologies", where Littletato worked, adopted a vacation system similar to that in Brazil.<br />
She also had several paid days off on holidays in the United States.<br />
<br />
Littletato then got up from the bed and did her morning needs, it was six forty in the morning.<br />
Then she woke Júlia up with a hug and kiss, which Júlia returned.<br />
Júlia also did her morning needs, and they both went to the kitchen.<br />
They started making breakfast, with sandwiches with ricotta cheese, lentil burgers, and mustard.<br />
And also cappuccino with milk to drink.<br />
Then the girls sat down at the table and began to eat their breakfast.<br />
"Hey love, when I moved to San Francisco, I thought it would be difficult for me to get used to the city, it's so big.<br />
And also with people, you know, since I have a little anxiety and social phobia...<br />
But since we started living together, I gained a lot of confidence in myself, you know, and I lost my fear of the city.<br />
All of this was because of you, love, you helped me a lot, so... Thanks love," said Júlia, smiling at Littletato.<br />
"Oh my love, that's good, I'm happy I helped you with that honey, you also helped me a lot to lose my fear of the big city, hihi.<br />
And also losing the fear of making friends, hehe, thanks honey," replied Littletato, who kissed Júlia.<br />
"You're welcome honey, I'm glad I helped you," said Júlia, returning the kiss.<br />
"I loved you so much the moment I saw you for the first time love, in that square...<br />
And then I asked you to have a coffee with me, I remember it like it was yesterday, hehe," said Littletato, remembering the happy moment.<br />
"I also loved you a lot at that moment love, I was so happy you called me...<br />
You looked at me, and I looked back, and I thought you were so beautiful, but I was embarrassed to go talk to you.<br />
Then you came to talk to me, and I was so happy... I also remember it as if it were yesterday," said Júlia, with her eyes full of tears.<br />
"Oh love... I'm glad you were happy, cutie, I love you so much," said Littletato, kissing Júlia.<br />
"I also love you very much, my beautiful little potato," replied Júlia, returning the kiss, and smiling back.<br />
Then, after this beautiful moment, remembering the beginning of their relationship, the girls continued to eat.<br />
They finished, Littletato cleaned and organized the table, and Júlia washed the breakfast dishes.<br />
<br />
Littletato did not have to work today, as she was on vacation the whole month.<br />
Then Littletato and Júlia walked to the computers' room, turning them on.<br />
They both sat in their computer chairs, it was seven twenty in the morning.<br />
The girls had their water bottles next to them, so they could drink water when they felt thirsty.<br />
Littletato opened Mozilla Firefox, her favorite browser, and opened "Foobar2000", her favorite music player.<br />
The girl had a lot of songs and anime soundtracks downloaded onto her hard drive (SSD).<br />
She opened the website "Wattpad", to write a story she had created a few months ago, called "The Castle of the Fearless Wizards".<br />
("Wattpad" is a stories website where users can read and write stories, and receive notes, comments, and views.)<br />
Littletato loved writing stories, since she was little, she always wrote stories in her school notebook.<br />
Júlia opened the program "Paint Tool SAI", to continue the drawing of an anime girl.<br />
"Hey love, want to listen to the soundtrack of Yuru Camp while you do your thing?" asked Littletato, looking at Júlia.<br />
"Yes, I do love, please," replied Júlia, looking back.<br />
Then Littletato put to play a song from the "Yuru Camp" anime on her computer's speakers.<br />
The song was very calm and relaxing, with acoustic guitar and violin.<br />
<div class="video-container" style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: -6%;"><iframe type="text/html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" class="border_radius_5_cent border_4px border_color_light_salmon" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cs4qzCzJTKk?autoplay=0&fs=1&iv_load_policy=1&showinfo=1&rel=0&cc_load_policy=1&start=0&end=0&" title="YouTube video player"></iframe></div><br /><br /><br /><br />
The anime was about girls who liked camping as a pastime.<br />
Littletato loved that anime, it was so calm and relaxing, and she liked the atmosphere of the anime.<br />
And she was happy listening to its soundtrack, just as she was when she watched it for the first time.<br />
Yuru Camp reminded her of her childhood memories, of riding her bike in the morning, and going to her grandfather's farm.<br />
The song which was playing was good for Littletato to write her story, and for Júlia to draw.<br />
"I love Yuru Camp love, it's very good and relaxing, hihi," said Júlia, drawing.<br />
"Yeah, I also love this anime love.<br />
It would be cool for us to go camping one day, right? Hihi," asked Littletato, smiling, and writing her story.<br />
"It really would honey, I would love it," replied Júlia, smiling.<br />
Júlia was almost finishing her drawing of an anime girl with grey hair and green eyes.<br />
And Littletato was almost finishing the third chapter of her story.<br />
She received various votes and positive comments on her story in the first two chapters.<br />
<br />
It was eight in the morning, Júlia finished her drawing, and Littletato finished her story chapter.<br />
Júlia posted her drawing on the "Deviant Art" website, where you can post drawings and receive favorites and comments.<br />
Littletato posted the third chapter of her story on Wattpad, already receiving some views from her readers.<br />
Then Littletato paused the current song of the Yuru Camp soundtrack which was playing.<br />
Littletato had a server in her house, which was like a portable computer.<br />
She bought it last month when she received her salary.<br />
In it, there was a hard drive that stored all the music, anime, cartoons, series, and movies that Littletato downloaded.<br />
These files could be accessed and streamed by any device in the house, including the television.<br />
Littletato also used the server to synchronize the music folder on the hard drive with her phone.<br />
This way Littletato could always have new and organized songs to listen to on her phone without needing the Internet.<br />
Littletato also had the animes "Sword Art Online" and "Yuru Camp" downloaded on the hard drive, with all seasons.<br />
The girl already had watched the entire first season of both animes.<br />
Littletato and Júlia turned off their computers and walked to their bedroom.<br />
They got their backpacks with their water bottles, phones, and headphones.<br />
The girls opened the door and got out with their bikes, starting to cycle through San Francisco.<br />
They both cycled to the park in the neighborhood where they lived.<br />
The same park where they and Iam had their picnic on a Saturday, in November 2019.<br />
(The picnic took place in the previous chapter, which is chapter three, entitled "The Picnic and the Visit".)<br />
Then the girls cycled through the park, going very fast, and having fun together.<br />
They had taken their phones and headphones.<br />
The girls were listening to the soundtrack of the anime Yuru Camp, which was downloaded on their phones.<br />
After a few minutes of cycling, the girls sat down on a bench in the park to rest for a while.<br />
They were drinking water to hydrate themselves, near their bicycles which were locked to a fence.<br />
The girls were looking at people walking in the park, and talking.<br />
And they saw two kids and a little dog playing with a Frisbee, and they got happy to see them playing.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of resting, it was time to leave, as the couple was hungry.<br />
It was already nine in the morning, so Littletato and Júlia got on their bikes.<br />
They started pedaling back home and then they arrived.<br />
The girls went inside the house and stored their bikes, locking the front door.<br />
Then they went to take a shower together because they were sweaty after riding their bikes a lot.<br />
After showering, they went to the bedroom and changed.<br />
The girls went to the kitchen and started preparing a snack for them to eat.<br />
Littletato prepared the slices of bread to make the sandwiches, spreading mayonnaise, adding ricotta cheese, and Barbecue sauce.<br />
Júlia was frying the lentil hamburgers that were frozen.<br />
After some minutes, they were fried, Júlia put them on the sandwiches and closed them.<br />
Littletato got two pretty glass cups and placed them on the table.<br />
Then she got a two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola which was in the freezer.<br />
She had bought the soda and some snacks on Sunday at the "Safeway" supermarket, where she often goes.<br />
Júlia and Littletato then picked up their plates and glasses and went to the living room.<br />
They left them on the coffee table, Littletato picked up the television remote and turned it on.<br />
Then Littletato opened the television application she created to access her media server.<br />
"What are we gonna watch today, love?" asked Júlia.<br />
"What do you think about us watching Yuru Camp again honey?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think it's a great idea love, I love this anime, it's so calm and relaxing, hihi," replied Júlia, smiling.<br />
"I love Yuru Camp too, hihi," said Littletato, smiling back.<br />
Then Littletato accessed the server's media folder, then the anime folder, and then the Yuru Camp folder.<br />
The girl played the first episode of the first season of the anime with subtitles.<br />
The couple started watching the anime again while eating their sandwich and drinking their soda.<br />
The anime had an original dub in Japanese, and subtitles in English.<br />
<br />
It begins by showing a group of girls camping around a campfire.<br />
They are roasting marshmallows and drinking hot tea, in cold, wearing very warm outerwear.<br />
The protagonist of the anime is called Rin Shima, she has dark blue hair and loves camping as a hobby.<br />
Then the opening of the anime plays, Littletato and Júlia love the opening and its song, it is very lively.<br />
After the opening, the anime shows Rin Shima riding a bicycle across an empty highway.<br />
She wishes to see Mount Fuji up close, and camp near it too, as it is beautiful and offers a great view.<br />
It is a Saturday, November 4, 2018, shown on Rin's phone.<br />
She was cycling to a camping spot where was going to camp.<br />
On the way, she sees a pink-haired girl sleeping on a bench, it is Nadeshiko Kagamihara.<br />
Rin thought that that girl would catch a cold from sleeping there.<br />
Littletato and Júlia were watching the episode and felt a strong nostalgia, getting happy.<br />
They were happy to remember the first time they watched the anime.<br />
The couple still had that same love for the anime they had before.<br />
Littletato was stroking Júlia's hair as they watched.<br />
Then Rin arrived at the place where she would camp, paying for the camping fee.<br />
After that, she cycled to the camping spot, parking her bike.<br />
The blue-haired girl breathed deeply, feeling the cool breeze.<br />
She had the entire campsite just for her.<br />
Few people camped in the winter season, as it was very cold.<br />
Then Rin stretched out and set up her tent, placing a sleeping bag inside.<br />
She also set up her table, chair, and portable gas stove.<br />
The girl then sat down in her chair, starting to read her book called "The Mystery of the Ancient X Civilization".<br />
It was five degrees Celsius in winter, and the wind was very cold.<br />
Rin was too lazy to make a campfire because it would be too much work and she would smell like smoke.<br />
A very cold breeze passes Rin's face, and she shivers from the cold.<br />
Then Rin reluctantly gets up and starts preparing things to make a campfire.<br />
She goes to a forest near the campsite and starts looking for pine cones to start the fire.<br />
The anime's narrator teaches the viewer how to find the best pine cones and firewood for campfires.<br />
And also how to prepare the firewood to make the campfire.<br />
Littletato was loving learning camping things from the anime.<br />
It seemed like so much fun, the girl wanted to try camping someday.<br />
The anime showed her how fun and relaxing camping is.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato and Júlia finished having lunch, they paused the anime episode, which was in nine minutes.<br />
It was ten in the morning, the girls were enjoying watching the anime together again.<br />
The couple took the plates and glasses to the kitchen sink, Littletato washed the dishes, and Júlia put them away.<br />
Then Júlia took the snacks from the cabinet, for her and Littletato to eat while watching the anime.<br />
The girls went to the living room and sat down, resuming the episode.<br />
In the episode, Rin needed to go to the bathroom, so she left the campsite.<br />
While walking, Rin saw Nadeshiko sleeping, but now on the ground, she must have fallen while sleeping.<br />
Rin looked at the scene indifferently and followed on her way.<br />
After that, she returned to the camp, lighting up the pine cone with a match, and setting up the campfire.<br />
The anime's narrator teaches the viewer how to light the campfire and place the firewood.<br />
Placing the thinnest branches first, gradually increasing their thickness, but leaving space for air to flow.<br />
Then Rin blows air at the campfire using a piece of cardboard, to provide oxygen for the fire.<br />
The girl then takes off her gloves and enjoys the warm fire of the campfire.<br />
She thinks about her parched face and the smell of smoke, ignoring both because of the heat of the fire.<br />
"I can't believe that girl sleeps in a place like that.<br />
I would freeze to death," thinks Rin, about Nadeshiko, the girl who was sleeping on the bench.<br />
Ena Saitou, Rin's school friend, sends her a message via the messaging app.<br />
"Where did you go today?" asks Saitou.<br />
Then Rin sends her a picture of where she was, with the Mount Fuji as seen from Lake Motosu.<br />
"Mount Fuji is wearing a hat," says Rin, because clouds are hiding the peak of Mount Fuji.<br />
"It happens, I hope the weather improves," replies Saitou.<br />
Then Saitou sends her a photo of her dog Chikuwa with a dog blanket, with the caption "Don't catch a cold".<br />
Some time passes, and the episode shows Nadeshiko's house.<br />
Nadeshiko's mother talks to her sister, Sakura Kagamihara, worried about Nadeshiko's disappearance.<br />
<br />
It is already night, Rin leaves her camp with her lantern.<br />
She goes to the bathroom again, having had too much soup.<br />
The girl comes out of the bathroom and notices that Nadeshiko is no longer there, "Disappeared," she thinks.<br />
"She must have already gone home right?" thinks Rin, who turns towards the direction of the camp.<br />
Rin is startled when she sees Nadeshiko awake in front of her, crying, and becomes scared.<br />
Then Rin drops her lantern and starts running back to her camp.<br />
Nadeshiko starts running behind her, crying, and trips over a chain at the beginning of the campsite.<br />
Rin then sits in her camp, with Nadeshiko in front of her, crying.<br />
"So you moved to Yamanshi today, was that it?" asks Rin.<br />
"It was!" replies Nadeshiko, crying.<br />
"And came by bike to see Mount Fuji, but got tired, slept too much, and when you woke up it was dark," says Rin.<br />
"Yeah," says Nadeshiko, crying more.<br />
"Look, it's a descent that way, you can get to the base of the mountain very quickly," explains Rin.<br />
"Oh impossible, no way it's very scary!" replies Nadeshiko, scared.<br />
"Why don't you call home and ask them to pick you up?" asks Rin.<br />
"Oh right!<br />
Oh my phone, I took my phone, where it is man, it was here...<br />
Oh wait, phone!" says Nadeshiko, showing a deck of fifty-two cards.<br />
The girl's belly growls soon after, and she falls to her knees, sighing.<br />
Then Rin offers some ramen to Nadeshiko since she is hungry.<br />
Nadeshiko accepts, and then Rin leaves the water for the ramen to heat on her gas stove.<br />
<br />
"You can use my phone if you want, what's your home number?" asks Rin.<br />
"It's that I just moved so I don't know..." replies Nadeshiko, sad and worried.<br />
"And what about your phone number?" asks Rin, "I have no idea either..." replies Nadeshiko.<br />
The water starts to boil, and Rin prepares the ramen, adding hot water.<br />
Nadeshiko sneezes, she caught a cold from sleeping on the ground.<br />
Littletato and Júlia identify with the girls of the anime.<br />
Júlia thinks she is like Nadeshiko, all cute and shy.<br />
And Littletato thinks she is like Rin, more serious, reflective, introspective, and relaxed.<br />
The ramen is ready, and Nadeshiko hums "Curry ramen" in a cute and fun way, happy with the food.<br />
Nadeshiko eats curry ramen with the biggest appetite, as if it were the most delicious thing in the world, very happy.<br />
Some time passes, and Rin asks where Nadeshiko is from.<br />
"I came from down below, a place called Nanbucho," replies her.<br />
"I can't believe you came all this way on your bike," says Rin.<br />
"It's that my sister said that a sight of Mount Fuji from Lake Motosu costs 1000 yen (6,35 dollars)," explains Nadeshiko.<br />
"I went all the way up the hill to see, but there were so many clouds that I didn't see anything!" continues her, upset.<br />
"Is that what you can't see?" asks Rin, Nadeshiko gets confused.<br />
"Look back," says Rin, Nadeshiko does it, and sees a beautiful view of Mount Fuji.<br />
<br />
The mountain's peak is clear, without clouds, and the Moon is shining brightly, illuminating the entire river, and the sky is clear and starry.<br />
Nadeshiko is very happy and surprised by the wonderful view of Mount Fuji at night.<br />
"Ahaha, I just remembered that I know my sister's number," says Nadeshiko, embarrassed.<br />
Then Rin lends Nadeshiko her phone, she calls her sister, and Sakura arrives with her car to pick up Nadeshiko.<br />
"For my stupid little sister, my sincere apologies," says Sakura Kagamihara, Nadeshiko's older sister.<br />
"It's my thanks," says her, offering a bag of kiwis to Rin.<br />
"Ah, no, it was nothing, really, it's okay," says Rin.<br />
The anime shows Nadeshiko in caricature form, with a bump on the head, in a comical way.<br />
"The phone is for you to bring with you wherever you go!<br />
Get in the car you little pig!" says Sakura, pulling Nadeshiko inside her car and kicking her lightly.<br />
"Ouch! Ouch! Stop! Stop I'm going to put out the curry ramen!" says Nadeshiko.<br />
Then Sakura gets inside the car, "Good night, don't get a cold," says her to Rin, and she says good night back..<br />
"My ramen turned into a bag of kiwis," thinks Rin, looking at the bag.<br />
"What a strange girl.<br />
Time to listen to some radio..." thinks her.<br />
Nadeshiko returns to talk to Rin, giving her a piece of paper with her phone number on it.<br />
"Thanks for the curry ramen!<br />
Next time, let's go camping for real!" says Nadeshiko, smiling, happy to have met Rin.<br />
"Yeah... She's weird...<br />
But... I think I'll add her," thinks Rin.<br />
The episode ends with its ending song, showing the way of Nadeshiko.<br />
She rides her bike to Utsubuna station, catching a train to school.<br />
The school of Rin is shown, with Rin talking with Saitou in the place of the students' shoes.<br />
Nadeshiko passes by and Rin feels her presence but does not see her.<br />
The viewers discover that Nadeshiko goes to the same school as Rin, and the two will meet again.<br />
A section called "Room Camp" is shown after the episode ends.<br />
Showing the characters Chiaki Ogaki and Aoi Inuyama in their Outdoor Activities Club.<br />
They talk about winter camping, heaters, and other things.<br />
<br />
Then the episode ended, and Littletato and Júlia were happy to watch the episode again, they love the anime.<br />
It was ten hours and fourteen minutes, the girls threw the bag of chips in the trash and washed their hands.<br />
They turned off the television and turned on their computers.<br />
The couple continued with their day, doing fun things together, and cooking.<br />
<br />

This chapter was originally written on November 2, 2017, at 02:34.<br />
It was last revised on July 3, 2024, at 23:14.<br />
And it was translated into English on July 10, 2024, at 01:02.<br />
<br />
This chapter is inspired by:<br />
"No Man's Sky", which is a science fiction game with adventure elements.<br />
Developed and published by independent studio "Hello Games".<br />
It was released on August 9, 2016, for PlayStation 4 and August 12 for computers.<br />
Players are free to explore an entire, procedurally generated universe.<br />
Which includes about 18 quintillion planets, all of them with their own flora and fauna.<br />
<br />
It was a Saturday, February 29, 2020, at seven in the morning.<br />
Littletato and Júlia already had breakfast, they were in the computer room.<br />
Júlia was on her laptop, and Littletato was on her desktop computer.<br />
Since January of this year, Júlia has been teaching Littletato how to draw digitally.<br />
She liked a lot learning how to draw line art with Júlia, and became very creative.<br />
Littletato was drawing an anime girl with an orange cat on her lap, in the program "Paint Tool SAI".<br />
The girl was already halfway through the drawing, and was very happy with the result.<br />
She had already made the lines and contours of the drawing, and was in the painting part.<br />
In the painting part, there are many details such as shadows and lights.<br />
The girl in the drawing had blonde hair and blue eyes, and resembled Ana, Littletato's mother, but Ana had green eyes.<br />
Littletato was listening to a music playlist of the "Future Bounce" genre on YouTube Music, while drawing.<br />
She liked that genre a lot, it was very fun and lively, and at the same time calm and light.<br />
<div class="video-container" style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: -6%;"><iframe type="text/html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" class="border_radius_5_cent border_4px border_color_light_salmon" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?autoplay=0&fs=1&iv_load_policy=1&showinfo=1&rel=0&cc_load_policy=1&start=0&end=0&list=PLh4DEvPQ2wKNAPTQuHnO19k8B2AQ7Day6" title="YouTube video player"></iframe></div><br /><br /><br /><br />
Júlia was listening to music too, on the "Spotify" application for computers.<br />
Where you could listen to songs for free, but have to listen to ads now and then, or pay for an ad-free plan.<br />
She was listening to a music playlist of the "Future Bass" genre, very cute and kawaii, and very relaxing.<br />
The girl was also chatting with her friends on Messenger, the Facebook messaging and chat section.<br />
And also on Discord, talking with several friends that she likes a lot, even though they are virtual friends.<br />
Discord is a free voice-over IP and textual communication app, and was initially designed for gaming communities.<br />
But several people from other groups and communities started using Discord, becoming a broad social network.<br />
There, Júlia was on various servers, which were like large groups with several chat rooms.<br />
She was on servers of her favorite games, such as "Don't Starve", "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)", and "Project Zomboid".<br />
Several of Júlia's virtual friends also liked art, they either drew or wrote stories.<br />
And Júlia loved talking about art with them, and also sharing her new drawings.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Littletato finished her drawing of the anime girl.<br />
Júlia was playing the game "Project Zomboid" in single-player mode, it was seven and a half in the morning.<br />
It is a survival and zombie apocalypse game, which Júlia finds very fun and deep.<br />
In it, you can search for survival items and weapons in desolate cities, with no humans, only zombies.<br />
And you can also create your own base inside houses, or build your own house with wooden walls.<br />
Júlia loved that game, and the creative freedom it gave her, allowing her to create specific characters.<br />
And also create their stories, including writing in diaries and notebooks that exist within the game.<br />
Littletato turned to Júlia and caught her attention.<br />
"Hey love, I finished that drawing I was making, what do you think?" asked Littletato, showing the screen of Paint Tool SAI to Júlia.<br />
Júlia then paused the game and turned to Littletato in her gaming chair.<br />
"Hmm... The drawing is very beautiful love!<br />
I liked it a lot, you learned so much, hehe," replied Júlia, smiling at Littletato.<br />
"Ah, thank you love, I'm happy you liked it," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"And I like the way you organize your layers and folders, it's very organized, hihi," continued Júlia.<br />
"Hehe, thank you very much honey, I like being organized.<br />
And thanks for teaching me how to draw during all these months," said Littletato, happy.<br />
"You're welcome honey," replied Júlia, smiling, and then returning to her game.<br />
Then Littletato posted her new drawing on her new Deviant Art account, which she had created in January.<br />
The girl also used Discord, and had sent the link to her new drawing to her friends who liked art.<br />
Some of her friends liked her new drawing a lot, and thought it was very beautiful, praising her.<br />
She also had a Discord server, where she posted her creations and photos, and her friends could see them.<br />
Júlia was on the server too, she was an administrator, and liked to post her creations in her section of the server.<br />
Littletato also used Twitter, a social network where you can post and read tweets of various famous and influential people.<br />
You can also comment, favorite, and repost a tweet for other people to see, and chat via direct messages.<br />
The girl posted her new drawings there too, to get views and favorites on the social network and Deviant Art.<br />
After a few minutes, there were already several views on both posts, and also some favorites.<br />
Littletato was happy that they liked her cute drawing.<br />
She does not need the approval of others to be proud of her art, but compliments make her happy.<br />
<br />
Then, after a few hours of daylight, it was ten hours and twenty minutes at night.<br />
The girls spent the day together, playing on their computers, sometimes alone, and sometimes together.<br />
They went to the supermarket together, to buy delicious things to eat, and also rice, beans, and soda.<br />
They also watched cool series on Netflix, like "The Walking Dead", and ate the delicious things they bought.<br />
The girls also rode their bikes around the city, went to the park, drank sugarcane juice, and ate fried pastries.<br />
After this busy day, the girls were tired, they already had dinner, showered, and went to sleep.<br />
They slept soundly on the cool night, covered with the blanket, spooning each other.<br />
The girls were so connected physically and mentally, that they began to have a dream together.<br />
Júlia and Littletato were on an icy blue planet, with a lot of snow on its surface.<br />
There were alien animals there, they seemed to have a lot of fur to protect themselves from the cold.<br />
The girls were shivering, hugging themselves, and breathing out white air, they wanted to find somewhere warm.<br />
They found the planet strange, not even the coldest places on planet Earth came close.<br />
Littletato was curious to know more and more about life on the planet.<br />
She and Júlia wore an Exosuit, which was like an astronaut suit and covered the whole body.<br />
The Exosuit gave them an inventory to store things, a Life Support system, and a Hazard Protection system.<br />
It protected them from planetary hazards, dangerous flora, and hostile fauna.<br />
The system protected the user from extreme heat, cold, toxicity, or radiation.<br />
Sentinels were intergalactic police officers who protected planets from space pirates and other intelligent and dangerous beings.<br />
The Exosuit came equipped with a jetpack, allowing the user to float for a few minutes.<br />
There was a strange creature near the girls, it had a humanoid form.<br />
Its head was a screen showing a symbol, which was supposed to be its face.<br />
Littletato did not understand much of what the creature was saying, but Júlia did.<br />
But when the creature said "Tetracovix" as it placed the hand on its chest, Littletato understood that it was its name.<br />
<br />
"Hey love, I think I understand a little of the language it is speaking.<br />
Its language and species name is called Korvax, they have no defined gender.<br />
And it is welcoming us to the planet Ramenses B," said Júlia to Littletato.<br />
"Wow, how cool love, where did you learn all that?" asked Littletato, curious.<br />
"I learned it from some knowledge stones that are here on the planet.<br />
When you touch it, it teaches you a word in the language of the most present intelligent species in this solar system.<br />
And well love, Tetracovix is also telling us that this planet is very cold and dangerous.<br />
And that we should have an upgrade called Thermic Layer on our Hazard Protection system.<br />
It says it saw us shivering from the cold, and it is going to give us this upgrade for free.<br />
We just need to go to its house, which is next door," replied Júlia.<br />
"I see, this is very interesting my love, so let's go there to get the upgrade," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
Júlia thanked Tetracovix for its hospitality and education, all in the Korvax language.<br />
Then the girls accompanied the Korvax to its house, and got the upgrades for the Exosuit with it.<br />
Júlia thanked it in the Korvax language, it emitted a happy sound, with its facial expression changing.<br />
They installed the two Thermic Layer upgrades on a technology slot on their Exosuits.<br />
After that, they left the house and started walking around the planet.<br />
The girls noticed that they had a multi-tool, it could mine ores and gems.<br />
It also could modify the terrain and fight against aliens with a strong laser beam.<br />
Júlia and Littletato's Life Support system was low on energy.<br />
It continuously filters and pumps breathable oxygen to the heart of the user.<br />
The girls needed oxygen in its pure form to recharge their systems.<br />
Then Júlia used her scanner to look for things that contained oxygen.<br />
<br />
She found some red plants and walked to them with Littletato.<br />
"Hey honey, is your life support system low on energy?<br />
If so, you can get this plant that will give you oxygen to recharge it," explained Júlia.<br />
"It is honey.<br />
Really? Good to know, hihi," said Littletato.<br />
Then both girls collected the fruit of the plant and recharged their Life Support systems to the maximum.<br />
They also recharged their Hazard Protection systems with Sodium they got from some yellow plants.<br />
The Exosuit collected organic matter and processed it to collect its base elements.<br />
The girls walked further and found a crashed spaceship on the ground.<br />
Littletato managed to repair the spaceship's systems with some elements she had in her inventory.<br />
The spaceship door opened and Littletato and Júlia entered inside.<br />
"Welcome back, Júlia and Littletato," said a female robotic voice from inside the spaceship.<br />
It appeared to be the artificial intelligence system that controlled the spaceship's systems.<br />
"How strange love... I don't remember us taking a spaceship...<br />
I just remember us exploring the planet," explained Littletato, confused.<br />
"I don't remember either love, very strange...<br />
Maybe Tetracovix transferred the ownership of a spare spaceship from it to us.<br />
Because I saw a spaceship parked near its house," said Júlia, also confused.<br />
"Yeah, that must be it love, well, I've never flown a spaceship before, hehe, it should be fun," said Littletato, putting her hands on the control sticks.<br />
The spaceship had two seats, one in front of the other, and did not have much freedom of movement to the sides.<br />
<br />
Littletato pressed a button that appeared to be the spaceship's startup button.<br />
The spaceship turned on, and four screens that displayed important information were activated.<br />
Littletato looked at the first screen on the left.<br />
It showed the name of the solar system where the spaceship was, along with a radar.<br />
The second screen showed the spaceship's speed, measured in U's per second.<br />
There was also a hologram between the four screens, which showed the map of the solar system in 3D.<br />
It showed the spaceship in the center as an arrow.<br />
And also interesting points in the solar system, like planets, the star, and space stations.<br />
But as Júlia and Littletato were inside of a planet, the system map did not show anything much useful.<br />
The map of the solar system did not show any text or pictures, just icons of different shapes and colors.<br />
The third screen showed the name of Littletato and Júlia's spaceship, which was called "Radiant Pillar BC1".<br />
It showed a hologram of the spaceship's silhouette in white, slowly rotating.<br />
And it also showed the condition of the spaceship's shield.<br />
The fourth screen showed the name of the currently selected weapon, as well as its energy.<br />
The Photon Cannon was the currently selected weapon, and it could also be used to mine asteroids in space.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_salmon border_radius_6_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/The Life of Littletato/Chapters/05/Images/Cockpit.png" style="max-width: 60%;" /><br /><br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_salmon border_radius_6_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/The Life of Littletato/Chapters/05/Images/Radiant Pillar BC1.png" style="max-width: 60%;" /><br /><br />
The spaceship had two control sticks in the center of it, where the steering wheel of a car would be.<br />
The left control stick could be pulled forward or backward, to control the spaceship's acceleration.<br />
And the right control stick controlled the spaceship's wings, changing the vertical direction or pitch.<br />
It also changed the lateral direction or roll of the spaceship.<br />
The right control stick had a red button in the middle to shoot with the currently selected weapon.<br />
Near the left stick, there was a red button that was used to make the spaceship take off or land.<br />
And next to the right stick, there was the button that Littletato pressed to start the spaceship.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_salmon border_radius_6_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/The Life of Littletato/Chapters/05/Images/Control sticks.png" style="max-width: 60%;" /><br /><br />
<br />
Littletato then pressed the lift-off button on the left and the spaceship lifted off.<br />
She pulled the right stick to the right, rotating the spaceship 360 degrees.<br />
The spaceship's nose was aimed at an animal on the planet, and Littletato accidentally pressed the fire button.<br />
A photon laser was shot at the animal, killing it.<br />
"Oops," said Littletato, worried, looking at the animal.<br />
Then a Sentinel appeared near the spaceship, scanning it with a blue light.<br />
The Sentinel's eye and its scanning light turned red.<br />
It looked like they had committed a planetary crime and there was a wanted level there.<br />
Littletato pulled the left stick forward and began flying around the planet, trying to escape the Sentinel.<br />
The Sentinels were like planetary police officers, who tried to protect the less intelligent species from other species.<br />
Always trying to maintain harmony on the planet, and punishing intelligent species that killed innocent animals.<br />
Littletato pointed the spaceship's nose upward by pulling the right stick back.<br />
Then she pulled the left stick forward, and the spaceship began to accelerate, passing through the atmosphere, and leaving the planet.<br />
Júlia and Littletato had arrived in space, they thought it was beautiful there, full of stars, planets, and the star of the solar system.<br />
They could see the big planets of various shapes, colors, and types, and they were happy to visit space.<br />
Littletato used the spaceship's scanner to obtain more information about the solar system.<br />
It was called "Irangbi VI", and it had three stars, one yellow, one green, and one purple, it was a ternary system.<br />
The solar system was in the Euclid galaxy, which was a galaxy with several unique solar systems.<br />
Littletato could send information about the galaxy, solar system, and planets to an information bank of the entity "Atlas".<br />
She would gain nanite clusters, which was a rare form of currency in the universe.<br />
Nanites could be used to purchase upgrades for spaceships, exosuits, and multi-tools.<br />
The most common type of currency was units, which could be used to purchase new spaceships, multi-tools, and raw resources.<br />
<br />
Littletato began piloting the spaceship around the solar system, looking at the different planets.<br />
She looked at the spaceship's inventory, she noticed that the Launch Thruster and Pulse Engine were low on energy.<br />
Then she pointed the spaceship at a cluster of asteroids, shooting at them.<br />
The asteroids had the elements necessary to recharge the spaceship's two technologies.<br />
"This game is very cool!" said Littletato, excited as she fired the lasers.<br />
"Wait, are we in a game, love?" asked Júlia in doubt, confused.<br />
"Ah... I think so love.<br />
It's just that everything we've been through so far reminded me of a game I played last month, about space exploration," explained Littletato.<br />
"I understand honey, how interesting, and curious, hehe.<br />
Can we go to another planet?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Of course honey, what kind of planet do you want?" asked Littletato, looking back.<br />
"A very warm one, I was starting to freeze on that planet we were on..." said Júlia, hugging herself.<br />
"Okay love," said Littletato, who recharged the Launch Thruster.<br />
She also recharged the Pulse Engine, and continued flying through the system.<br />
Littletato scanned the solar system again, and found a hot planet called "Baalic".<br />
She piloted the spaceship there, entered its atmosphere, and began flying around the planet.<br />
After some time flying, Littletato found a planetary base.<br />
A blue circle appeared near the base, blinking, indicating a parking spot.<br />
Littletato then pointed the spaceship's nose at the indicated point using the right stick.<br />
The circle turned green, and Littletato pressed the landing button on the left and landed the spaceship.<br />
Júlia and Littletato started walking around the planet, looking for cool things to do.<br />
<br />
The girls found a crashed spaceship with smoke and a robotic terminal next to it, emitting a distress signal.<br />
Júlia interacted with the machine and read its log, which was in the girls' language.<br />
The log said that some space pirates shot at this spaceship and destroyed it.<br />
They were trying to steal rare plants that the spaceship contained, to sell.<br />
Júlia discovered that the pilot managed to escape the pirates while racing around the planet.<br />
The pilot also found a deposit of very rare minerals, such as gold and platinum.<br />
He found some elements to recharge protection devices.<br />
And also various useful materials to build upgrades for the Exosuit, multi-tool, and the spaceship.<br />
Júlia could see the location of the mineral deposit on her Analysis Visor, which was on the helmet of the Exosuit.<br />
Then she explained everything she read and learned to Littletato.<br />
"Do you want to go to the mineral deposit, my love?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yes, let's go love, there must be a lot of good stuff for us to mine," replied Littletato.<br />
Júlia saw a small animal near them and thought it was very cute.<br />
She analyzed him with her Analysis Visor and gave him the name "Fufu", uploading her discovery to the Atlas database.<br />
By analyzing the animal, Júlia discovered what he liked to eat, so she gave him food.<br />
Fufu got happy and wagged his tail to Júlia and Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Aww, how cute!<br />
Can we bring him with us love?" asked Júlia, happy with her new little pet.<br />
"Of course love, hehe," replied Littletato, smiling.<br />
Then Júlia caressed Fufu, giving him to Littletato to hold.<br />
"Take good care of him, love, because I'll pilot the ship now, hehe," said Júlia.<br />
"Okay love, good luck," said Littletato.<br />
Then Júlia went to the pilot's seat, and Littletato went to the back seat, holding Fufu.<br />
Júlia began to pilot the spaceship towards the mineral deposit.<br />
The girls already had the Terrain Manipulator upgrade on their multi-tools.<br />
This upgrade allowed them to manipulate the terrain however they wanted, and also collect the minerals from the deposit.<br />
Littletato was thinking about repairing the crashed spaceship for Júlia to pilot.<br />
Then the girls stayed dreaming the fun dream and spending time together.<br />
They continued to sleep hugging each other in the cold night, happy to be together.

This chapter was originally written on November 21, 2017, at 02:54.<br />
It was last revised on July 18, 2024, at 22:29.<br />
And it was translated into English on July 25, 2024, at 22:18.<br />
<br />
It was a Saturday, March 14, 2020, at six in the morning.<br />
Today Littletato did not have to work.<br />
But she still liked waking up early to have more free time in the day.<br />
Littletato and Júlia woke up and did their morning needs.<br />
Then they went to the kitchen to make breakfast.<br />
Littletato defrosted and fried two jackfruit meat burgers she and Júlia had prepared.<br />
Júlia prepared two cappuccinos with coffee, milk, cocoa powder, and cinnamon.<br />
Then Littletato spread ketchup and mayonnaise on the two sandwiches she was preparing.<br />
She also added a slice of ricotta cheese to each sandwich.<br />
After that, she added the vegan jackfruit meat burgers and closed the sandwiches.<br />
Júlia had already finished the cappuccinos and left them on the table.<br />
She decided to grill the sides of the bread on the frying pan, to create a crispy crust.<br />
Then the sandwiches were ready, the girls sat at the table.<br />
They started eating their sandwiches and drinking their cappuccinos.<br />
"Wow, the jackfruit burgers are very delicious love!" said Júlia, smiling.<br />
"Thanks love, they turned out very good, I liked making them with you, hihi," replied Littletato, smiling too.<br />
"Hey honey, want to go for a bike ride around the park today?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yes I want honey," replied Littletato.<br />
After a few minutes, the girls finished eating, the breakfast was delicious.<br />
They took their plates and cups to the sink, Littletato washed the dishes and Júlia stored them.<br />
<br />
Between February and March, Littletato continued making her drawings on Paint Tool SAI and posting them on Deviant Art.<br />
She improved so much in her art that she began taking commissions.<br />
The customer would say how they wanted the drawing, pose, scenery, and colors, sending half the money to Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato would send a draft of the drawing to the customer.<br />
Will the customer approve, Littletato would begin working on the drawing, showing the progress to the customer.<br />
The customer may request any changes to the drawing as well.<br />
After that, Littletato would receive the rest of the money and deliver the commission.<br />
Littletato was very happy with her progress and evolution in her art.<br />
The girl also continued writing her stories on Wattpad, especially her story "The Castle of the Fearless Wizards".<br />
This story of hers already had five chapters written, and several votes and comments.<br />
Júlia also started earning money with her drawings and making pixel art.<br />
In the present, Littletato and Júlia went to the computer room and turned them on.<br />
They talked a little with their friends on their social networks, mainly on Discord.<br />
After a few minutes of talking, they said goodbye to their friends, it was seven and a half in the morning.<br />
Júlia was listening to a playlist of rock songs she had created.<br />
The songs were playing on the external speakers connected to her laptop, and Littletato was liking them.<br />
Littletato had remembered a space exploration game she played in January.<br />
She purchased it for her Steam gaming account on January 1st.<br />
It was a game called "No Man's Sky", Littletato loved that game.<br />
The girl remembered it because of a dream she had about it last month, February 29th.<br />
It was a dream she had with Júlia, where they were exploring the game's universe, having an Exosuit, multi-tool, and spaceship.<br />
<br />
"Hey love, remember a dream we had last month?<br />
A dream of space exploration, you even said you dreamed the same dream as me, hihi," asked Littletato to Júlia.<br />
Júlia paused the song and turned her chair to Littletato.<br />
"I do remember love, it was a very fun and very detailed dream, I loved dreaming with you, hihi.<br />
But why honey?" asked Júlia, curious.<br />
"Ah, it's that I remembered the game I played in January, which looks a lot like the dream, it's No Man's Sky.<br />
And I wanted to play it with you, can I buy it for your account honey?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I got it my dear, it seems like a fun game, yes you can love, thank you!" replied Júlia, smiling.<br />
"You're welcome my love," said Littletato, then she bought the game as a gift to Júlia's Steam account.<br />
Júlia installed the game "No Man's Sky" on her laptop, it was very powerful.<br />
Then the girls opened the game, they were going to play in the multiplayer mode.<br />
Littletato still had her January game saved, but she wanted to play from scratch to teach Júlia the game.<br />
They started playing, exploring the game, scavenging for resources, and repairing their initial spaceships.<br />
Doing everything like the dream they dreamed of in February.<br />
The girls were on a hot planet and managed to purchase two upgrades called "Coolant Network".<br />
That upgrade to the Exosuit helped cool the user's body, allowing them to withstand high temperatures.<br />
While playing with Júlia, Littletato remembered what her twentieth birthday was like on February 4, 2020.<br />
Júlia had bought her a cake and thrown her surprise party, Iam also came to the party.<br />
The two sang happy birthday to her, Littletato served the first slice of cake to Júlia, and the second to Iam.<br />
There was Coca-Cola, Guarana soda, sweets, and vegan snacks, of jackfruit meat and lentils, Iam also brought some.<br />
It also had calm and relaxing songs from the soundtrack of the anime "Yuru Camp".<br />
Júlia had played the songs on the speaker in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Littletato always celebrated her birthdays at her parents' house, before leaving on a trip in 2019.<br />
She met Júlia in San Francisco in the second half of 2019.<br />
The girl was very happy to have celebrated her first birthday with Júlia and Iam.<br />
She received a happy birthday from her parents and her sister Carol, via WhatsApp.<br />
Littletato made posts on her social media, saying that today was her birthday, and receiving a happy birthday from her friends.<br />
After a few hours of playing No Man's Sky, it was ten and forty in the morning.<br />
Littletato and Júlia were already well advanced in the game, they had greatly improved their Exosuits and multi-tools.<br />
They had also acquired new spaceships, made upgrades on them, and built a base for them on a cool planet.<br />
The girls saved the game and closed it, they got very happy to play the game together.<br />
Júlia and Littletato had digital diaries in the form of text files, organized by year and month folders.<br />
Text files were created for each day in her life.<br />
They wrote about their gaming session in their diaries.<br />
The girls were hungry, so they closed Steam and went to the kitchen to make something to eat.<br />
Littletato heated the rice and beans, and Júlia prepared a salad.<br />
She also made scrambled eggs well seasoned with salt, black pepper, oregano, and mozzarella cheese.<br />
The girls ate lunch while talking about their day and the game, the food was delicious.<br />
They also drank Coca-Cola while they ate, as it was Saturday.<br />
After eating, they washed their plates and cups, storing them.<br />
Littletato and Júlia went to the living room and sat on the couch.<br />
Júlia got the remote controller and turned on the television, opening the Netflix app.<br />
<br />
"What do you want to watch today love?" asked Júlia, with her head on Littletato's shoulder.<br />
"I think I want to watch My Little Pony again love, what about you?" asked Littletato, caressing Júlia.<br />
"Sounds like a good idea, hihi," replied Júlia.<br />
Then she played the cartoon "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic", released on October 10, 2010.<br />
The cartoon ended on October 12, 2019, with nine seasons and two hundred and twenty-two episodes.<br />
A spin-off movie of the series, titled "My Little Pony: Equestria Girls", was released on October 6, 2013.<br />
The movie showed the human version of the ponies from the main series.<br />
Another movie was also released on October 6, 2017, titled "My Little Pony: The Movie".<br />
Two special episodes were released in 2018 and 2019, including a Christmas special.<br />

<br />
Littletato and Júlia started watching the cartoon again.<br />
Starting with the first episode of the first season, entitled "Friendship Is Magic, Part 1", with twenty-two minutes.<br />
They loved watching My Little Pony, it was part of their childhood when they watched it as children.<br />
The girls got very happy to relive that beautiful moment which was watching that incredible cartoon for the first time.<br />
Júlia and Littletato also watched the second episode "Friendship Is Magic, Part 2" again.<br />
It was half past eleven in the morning, and they had already rested their bellies watching.<br />
They had planned to go to the park this morning, so they started getting ready.<br />
Júlia turned off the television and computers, then she packed her backpack.<br />
Littletato also packed hers, putting in her phone, headphones, and wallet.<br />
They both grabbed their bikes, storing their water bottles on the support.<br />
Júlia left her backpack next to Littletato's backpack on the couch.<br />
She went to hang out some clothes that were in the washing machine in the laundry room.<br />
<br />
Then Júlia finished, and the girls left on their bikes, cycling to the park in the neighborhood where they lived in San Francisco.<br />
After a few minutes of cycling, they arrived at the park and parked their bikes, locking them.<br />
The sky was clear and the sun was strong, the girls had brought sunscreen, so they put it on.<br />
There were a lot of kids, adults, and dogs playing in the park, with Frisbee and ball.<br />
Júlia and Littletato sat on a bench at the park, looking around, and drinking water from their bottles.<br />
They noticed that a friend of theirs was there, Iam, he was with a girl, walking through the park.<br />
Iam looked at the girls, Júlia waved to him, and he came over to them.<br />
"Heey, how are you girls?" asked Iam, smiling.<br />
"Heey," said the girl who was with Iam.<br />
"Good, and with you Iam?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Same, I'm glad.<br />
This is my sister Isabella, and these are my friends Júlia and Littletato," replied Iam.<br />
"Ah, nice to meet you, Isabella," said Júlia.<br />
"It's nice to meet you," said Littletato.<br />
"The pleasure is all mine, hihi," said Isabella, smiling, it was eleven fifty in the morning.<br />
Isabella was twenty-one years old in 2019, and was born on May 22, 1999.<br />
She had dark brown hair, brown eyes, and white skin, and was bisexual.<br />
The girl worked as a saleswoman in a clothing store.<br />
"When I saw you two from afar, I thought you were his girlfriend, haha," said Littletato.<br />
"Haha, no no, but we look alike right, hehe," said Isabella.<br />
"Yes, a little," said Júlia, smiling, then Iam and Isabella sat down next to the girls.<br />
<br />
"Iam told me you're not from here, what city do you live in Isabella?" asked Littletato, curious.<br />
"I live in San Diego, but I was born in San Jose.<br />
Iam was born here in San Francisco, when our parents were living here for a few months.<br />
Then we went back to San Jose, Iam grew up there and wanted to come back here to live.<br />
And you?" asked Isabella.<br />
"Well, I was born and raised in Los Angeles, I wanted to travel around California in 2019.<br />
Then I arrived in San Francisco and met Júlia, and decided to stay," explained Littletato.<br />
"I was born and raised in New York, then I decided to move to San Francisco in 2017.<br />
My parents and sister helped me at the beginning with money.<br />
Then I got a job and started saving money in the bank," explained Júlia.<br />
"I see, that is very interesting, you two moved away from your hometowns.<br />
And started a new life in another city, alone, you're very similar in that way, that's cute, hehe," said Isabella, smiling.<br />
"Thanks!" said Júlia, smiling too, "Your name starts with the same letter, that's cute too," continued her.<br />
"You're welcome hihi, and that's right, we're very close, and we love each other so much.<br />
Isn't it little bro?" asked Isabella, who hugged Iam tightly, smiling.<br />
"It is little sis, hihi," said Iam, who returned Isabella's hug, stroking her hair.<br />
"We brought some food for a picnic in the park, do you want to participate?" asked Iam.<br />
"Ah, we'd love to, right love?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, it's going to be very fun!" replied Júlia, it was midday.<br />
<br />
Isabella had a car, the group went to it to get the picnic items.<br />
Then she opened it and everyone helped carry the things to the park.<br />
Littletato and Júlia chose a good place and Isabella placed the towel.<br />
Iam set up the picnic, then everyone sat on the ground.<br />
Júlia and Littletato left their backpacks on the floor, near them.<br />
Isabella and Iam had brought soda, chocolate cake, and jackfruit meat Coxinhas.<br />
Everyone started eating, the food was delicious.<br />
Littletato and Júlia were happy to meet Iam's sister and make another friend.<br />
"Hey Littletato, have you ever thought about traveling to Texas?" asked Isabella.<br />
"Ah, I think so, there must be a lot of cool tourist attractions there right?<br />
It must be like a tourist city, like São Paulo in Brazil," replied Littletato.<br />
"Yes, it's very interesting there, from what I saw, I want to go visit," said Isabella.<br />
"That's right, I saw that the car trip takes one day.<br />
Well, we don't have a car, but when we do, we might think about going," said Littletato.<br />
"Ah love, I think your aunt Luísa lives there right?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yes, one more reason for us to travel there, hihi," replied Littletato.<br />
Then the group finished drinking the soda and eating the food, they took photos together.<br />
Isabella also gave her phone number to Júlia and Littletato, and the three of them added each other.<br />
There were still Coxinhas and pieces of cake left over from the picnic.<br />
Everyone helped collect the picnic things and store them in Isabella's car.<br />
Isabella and Iam got into the car and looked at the girls.<br />
"It was great meeting you, and having the picnic with you, thanks!" said Júlia, smiling.<br />
"I agree love, it was very cool!" said Littletato.<br />
"I thank you, hihi, you are very cool, it was nice to meet you too," said Isabella, smiling too.<br />
<br />
"Well, we're going, bye guys!" said Iam.<br />
"Byeee," said Isabella, they both waved their hands.<br />
Júlia and Littletato said bye back, waving too, and smiling.<br />
The siblings were taking some of the food home, and the couple too, in bowls.<br />
Then Isabella started driving to Iam's house.<br />
The girls walked to their bikes and unlocked them.<br />
They stored their bowls of food in their backpacks, then got on their bikes.<br />
Littletato and Júlia drank some water, then started cycling home.<br />
The girls arrived and unloaded their backpacks, storing the Coxinhas and cake on the fridge, and the other things in the bedroom.<br />
Júlia sent the photos she took at the picnic to Littletato, Iam, and Isabella.<br />
Both girls put their phones to charge in the bedroom, it was one o'clock in the afternoon.<br />
Littletato and Júlia spent the afternoon together, doing fun things at home.<br />
Playing, watching, eating, and talking, and also doing housework.<br />
It was eleven o'clock at night, and the girls were watching a series on Netflix while eating delicious things.<br />
They had already finished eating, and Júlia was a little sleepy, she had fallen asleep on Littletato's shoulder.<br />
The living room had the lights off, very dark, with only the low light from the television illuminating the wall and the couch.<br />
Littletato paused the series and picked up Júlia, taking her to the bedroom.<br />
She left Júlia on the bed and covered her with a warm blanket.<br />
Then the girl went to the living room and turned off the television, she brushed her teeth in the bathroom.<br />
<br />
After that, she went to lie down next to Júlia, hugging her and covering herself.<br />
"Hi love... Hmm..." said Júlia, who had woken up slightly.<br />
"Hii baby, you're awake, hihi," said Littletato, kissing Júlia and caressing her.<br />
"I was so sleepy honey, that I ended up sleeping on the couch..." said Júlia, returning the kiss.<br />
"Owwn honey, so cute, my sweet, hihi," said Littletato, who kissed Júlia again.<br />
Then Júlia went to brush her teeth, came back, closed the door, and lay down with Littletato.<br />
The two hugged each other tightly, covering themselves well, and smiling.<br />
"Good night honey, I love you very much," said Littletato, who kissed Júlia.<br />
"Hmm... Good night my dear, I love you very much too," said Júlia, returning the kiss.

This chapter was originally written on January 2, 2018, at 22:12.<br />
It was last revised on August 7, 2024, at 22:32.<br />
And it was translated into English on August 17, 2024, at 14:45.<br />
<br />
It was a Sunday, March 29, 2020, at eight in the morning.<br />
Littletato and Júlia woke up almost simultaneously, looking at each other.<br />
"I love you darling..." said Littletato, who kissed Júlia.<br />
"I love you too honey, you make me so happy," said Júlia, who returned the kiss and smiled at Littletato, hugging her.<br />
Then they did their morning needs and went to the kitchen.<br />
Júlia and Littletato made a delicious breakfast together.<br />
The girls went to the living room, Littletato turned on the television and opened the Netflix app.<br />
They ate while rewatching an episode of the anime Yuru Camp.<br />
After eating, Júlia washed the dishes and Littletato helped her by storing them.<br />
"Hey love, wanna play a little on our Xbox One?" asked Júlia, smiling at Littletato.<br />
"Yes I want love, let's go!" replied Littletato.<br />
The girls had their hands dirty from the sandwiches.<br />
So they washed their hands with detergent and returned to the living room.<br />
Júlia turned on the Xbox One and grabbed the two pink controllers, giving one to Littletato.<br />
After that, they waited for the video game to boot up, and then Júlia opened the Spotify app.<br />
She put on a playlist of the contemporary folk music genre to play.<br />
Júlia and Littletato had four Microsoft accounts on their Xbox One.<br />
The names of the accounts were "Littletato and Júlia", "Littletato", "Júlia", and "Guests".<br />
This is because saved games are stored on the account used to play.<br />
So Júlia could play the story of the game "Far Cry 5" for example.<br />
And Júlia's saved game would not interfere with Littletato's saved game.<br />
The main account with both of their names was used for cooperative games.<br />
Games like "Overcooked 2", "Sea of Thieves", "GTA Online", "Minecraft", and "A Way Out".<br />
The guests' account was used to store the saved games of friends and family who visited Júlia and Littletato.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Júlia's house had a storeroom, where they kept not-so-important things.<br />
There were two very comfortable gamer chairs with headrests.<br />
Littletato had bought two more chairs like the ones she and Júlia already had.<br />
She bought them because they were on sale, where four chairs would be cheaper than two.<br />
The center table of the living room was retractable and easy to disassemble.<br />
So Júlia and Littletato disassembled the table and stored it in the spacious storeroom.<br />
They brought the two spare gamer chairs and placed them in front of the television.<br />
After that, Júlia and Littletato got their water bottles and left them on the living room shelf.<br />
They sat on the gamer chairs, and Littletato paused the Spotify song.<br />
Júlia then put the game "Titanfall 2" for her and Littletato to play together.<br />
(Titanfall 2 is a first-person shooter game produced by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts.<br />
It was released on October 28, 2016, for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.<br />
The game is a sequence of Titanfall, released in 2014.<br />
The Titans shown in the game are huge Mecha robots with Artificial Intelligence used in the war.)<br />
In the game, there is a multiplayer mode, where the players battle each other and utilize the Titans.<br />
Littletato and Júlia were very good in the player combat mode, they won frequently.<br />
There was a waiting time before calling your Titan into battle and entering it to control it.<br />
This way players could not keep summoning their Titan all the time, as it is very powerful.<br />
Júlia and Littletato won various matches of the game along with their team and used their Titans a lot.<br />
The pilot that players control has a jump kit that helps with parkour, double jumps, and wall running.<br />
Each pilot has a class with specific skills that improve their offensive or defensive ability.<br />
Unlike its predecessor, Titanfall 2 had a story campaign, and not only the multiplayer mode.<br />
The game focuses on the story of Jack Cooper, he is a soldier who wants to be a Titan pilot.<br />
He receives the Titan BT-7274 to be his teammate on the missions.<br />
Júlia and Littletato had already played the game's story twice on their individual accounts.<br />
They loved the game's story, it was very emotional and fun, and they liked battling as a pilot or Titan.<br />
<br />
After playing various multiplayer matches of the game, it was already nine-thirty in the morning.<br />
Littletato and Júlia were tired of playing Titanfall 2, so they closed the game.<br />
They had already drunk all the water from the one-liter bottles during the hour and a half of play.<br />
Júlia hugged Littletato and kissed her cheek, "I love playing with you love," said her smiling.<br />
"I love playing with you too my love," said Littletato, returning the hug and kiss.<br />
Then Júlia put the contemporary folk songs playlist to play again.<br />
Littletato kept caressing Júlia's hair while they both decided what they were going to play next.<br />
They were looking through the main account's game library to choose a cooperative game.<br />
Littletato had purchased various games for the Xbox One with her salary and investments.<br />
The girls chose the game "Overcooked! 2" to play together, and paused the song again.<br />
They played the game for some hours, placing orders and delivering them to customers.<br />
The game gets a little chaotic when many orders appear at once, and they become very complex.<br />
Júlia and Littletato love playing this game because it makes them laugh a lot when they get the orders wrong.<br />
The girls were very happy playing the game and laughing together.<br />
After some hours of playing Overcooked and other cooperative games, it was eleven and ten in the morning.<br />
The couple was already hungry, as they had breakfast at eight.<br />
Littletato turned off the Xbox One, and Júlia turned on the Bluetooth speakers in the kitchen, pairing it with her phone.<br />
Júlia put the soundtrack of the anime "Yuru Camp" to play in the kitchen, very relaxing and calm, but lively too.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Júlia decided to order pizza and Coca-Cola for lunch as today was Sunday.<br />
They ordered a caramelized pumpkin and vegan cheese pizza, and a two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola.<br />
On the pizza, there was pumpkin, vegan cheese, garlic, onion, black olive, and tomatoes.<br />
The girls ordered the food on the "Food Shopper" app on Littletato's phone.<br />
The delivery arrived after a few minutes, and Júlia was setting the table while Littletato received the delivery.<br />
Littletato paid the delivery man twenty-five dollars, thanked him, and went back inside.<br />
She locked the front door and walked to the kitchen, leaving the pizza and soda on top of the table.<br />
Then Júlia and Littletato stored the two spare chairs in the storeroom, they assembled the center table again.<br />
Júlia placed the plates, cutlery, and beautiful cups on the table.<br />
She placed a slice of pizza on Littletato's plate and filled her cup with Coca-Cola.<br />
"Thanks love," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"You're welcome honey, hihi," replied Júlia, then Littletato did the same to Júlia, and she thanked her.<br />
They sat on the couch, with their pizza plates on their laps, and the cups of Coca-Cola on the center table.<br />
Júlia picked up the remote that was beside her on the couch, turning the television on.<br />
Then Júlia opened the Netflix app, she put the series "Black Mirror" for them to watch.<br />
(Black Mirror is a British science fiction anthology television series created by Charlie Brooker.<br />
It centers on dark and satirical themes that examine modern society, particularly concerning the unforeseen consequences of new technologies.<br />
The episodes are stand-alone works, which generally take place in an alternative present or near future.<br />
The series was first broadcast on the network "Channel 4" in the United Kingdom, in December 2011.<br />
Regarding the content and structure of the series, Charlie Brooker said:<br />
"Each episode has a different cast, a different setting, even a different reality, but they are all about the way we live now.<br />
And the way we could be living in ten minutes if we are clumsy".)<br />
It is a very interesting series that talks about the present and future of the technologies we utilize.<br />
Littletato and Júlia liked the series a lot, they liked seeing all the scenarios in which technology could go wrong.<br />
Then the girls started eating while watching the second episode of the second season.<br />
<br />
After eating and watching a few more episodes of the series, the girls had already finished eating.<br />
It was midday, and Júlia and Littletato brought the plates, cutlery, and cups to the kitchen sink.<br />
Littletato washed the dishes and Júlia helped her by storing them.<br />
After that, the girls got ready to go for a bike ride around the city.<br />
They packed their backpacks, storing their earphones, phones, and wallets.<br />
The girls also put their water bottles on the supports of the bikes, drinking some beforehand.<br />
Júlia and Littletato left the house on their bicycles, starting to cycle around the city of San Francisco.<br />
Then they put a playlist of contemporary folk songs to play on their phones, on Spotify.<br />
The sun was shining in the sky, and it was cool, it was a beautiful day for cycling.<br />
The girls were very happy to travel around the city together, passing through the streets, and seeing the nature of San Francisco.<br />
It was so good to feel the wind and the cool breeze, the calm songs on the playlist were like a soundtrack for the moment.<br />
Littletato and Júlia started cycling to the park, always respecting the traffic signs, and riding on the bike path.<br />
After a few minutes of cycling, they arrived at the park and entered it, cycling through the grass.<br />
They saw various kids and puppies playing in the park and got happy about it.<br />
The current song that was playing on the girls' phones was very lively and cool and had a good beat for the moment.<br />
Júlia and Littletato cycled to some fences in the park and drank some more water.<br />
They parked their bikes there, locking them, and pausing the songs.<br />
The girls walked to a vending cart selling fried pastels and sugarcane juice.<br />
"Which one you want love?" asked Júlia to Littletato.<br />
"Ah, I want the one with cheese and hearts of palm, and you love?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I want the one with broccoli, Catupiry, and cheese," replied Júlia, it was midday and a half.<br />
Then Júlia made the order to the young man and he started preparing, the smell of the pastels was delicious.<br />
She also asked for two cups of sugarcane juice with pineapple, each with five hundred milliliters.<br />
<br />
The girls sat on the chairs at a table that was near the vending cart.<br />
After a few minutes of waiting, the order arrived, and Júlia and Littletato began to eat and drink.<br />
"The pastels are very good right honey? Hihi," asked Júlia smiling.<br />
"Yes, it's really very good, and the sugarcane juice too, very sweet with pineapple, hihi," replied Littletato, smiling too.<br />
Littletato shared some of her palm heart pastel with Júlia, for her to taste, and Júlia did the same.<br />
Júlia loved spending some time and doing things with Littletato, she got very happy and liked being romantic with her.<br />
She looked at Littletato and noticed that her mouth was dirty, so Júlia cleaned it romantically, and Littletato smiled.<br />
"Thanks love," said Littletato, "You're welcome love, hihi," said Júlia.<br />
The girls took pictures together, of the food, and them in the park.<br />
They posted the photos on their Instagram, and also on their WhatsApp status.<br />
Littletato could not bear to eat the other half of her palm heart pastel, leaving it to Júlia.<br />
"You can eat, love, I can't take it, I drank too much sugarcane juice," said Littletato, giving a little giggle.<br />
"Thanks, honey," said Júlia smiling, she was still eating her broccoli pastel with Catupiry and cheese.<br />
Júlia ate slowly, enjoying the food and its taste, but she ate a lot, more than Littletato at least.<br />
Then the girls finished eating their pastels and drinking their sugarcane juices, the food was very good.<br />
They threw the things in the trash, and Littletato went to the vending cart to pay.<br />
The girl paid twenty-three dollars for the pastels and sugarcane juices, it was one in the afternoon.<br />
Then the girls walked to a bench that was near their bikes and sat down to rest their bellies.<br />
After some minutes of resting, Littletato took another photo of her and Júlia sitting in the park.<br />
They got up and unlocked their bikes, putting their earphones back on.<br />
The girls put the same playlist to play again and started cycling back home.<br />
<br />
Then they arrived home and went in, storing their bikes in the living room, which was quite large.<br />
After that, they stored their backpacks in the bedroom, removing their phones from inside.<br />
They also stored their water bottles in the fridge.<br />
Littletato and Júlia were a little sweaty after riding their bikes a lot.<br />
The girls went to the bathroom and took a shower together.<br />
After that, the girls went to the computer room and turned them on.<br />
They sat in their comfortable gamer chairs.<br />
Littletato finished posting the photos she took with Júlia, she posted them on Instagram and WhatsApp status.<br />
The girls wrote on their digital diaries about how their day has been so far.<br />
They opened their favorite browsers and their social networks and started responding to some messages and seeing notifications.<br />
Littletato had various notifications and news to see on Discord, on the servers of her favorite games.<br />
After several minutes, the girls finished checking their notifications, they closed their social networks.<br />
Júlia opened Paint Tool SAI to continue drawing a drawing of a grey-haired anime girl, with a futuristic scenery behind her.<br />
She had greatly improved her line art and painting and learned how to make better shadows.<br />
Littletato continued writing her story called "The Castle of the Fearless Wizards".<br />
It was a story of magic that took place in the medieval era, with knights, swords, armor, castles, and kingdoms.<br />
The girl liked this medieval theme a lot, she found it very interesting.<br />
Littletato stopped writing on Wattpad because she thought it was very bad.<br />
She was a programmer and also knew how to make websites in the "PHP" programming language.<br />
So she made a website for her story, and also a way to write its chapters locally.<br />
The girl continued writing chapter six of the story, in Brazilian Portuguese.<br />
Littletato was fluent in Brazilian Portuguese and English, but she preferred to write in Portuguese because she felt more creative that way.<br />
She had all of the chapters and information of her stories saved on the hard drive.<br />
They were very well-organized folders, which made it easy to find important information.<br />
<br />
The girls spent the day drawing, writing, eating, watching, and playing together.<br />
Júlia had finished her drawing of the anime girl and posted it on Deviant Art and her social network.<br />
Littletato had finished chapter six of her story, she posted it on the story's website, Wattpad, and Spirit Fanfics.<br />
The girl also posted the chapter link on her social networks, such as Discord, Facebook, and Twitter.<br />
It was already eleven o'clock at night, the girls had already had afternoon coffee and dinner.<br />
They turned off their computers and went to brush their teeth.<br />
After that, they both lay down on the bed, covering themselves.<br />
"Hey honey, let's sleep spooning each other?" asked Júlia, smiling.<br />
"Yes honey, let's go, hihi," replied Littletato, who hugged Júlia, spooning her, in love.<br />
"I had a lot of fun today, thanks honey," said Júlia.<br />
"You're welcome my dear, I had a lot of fun too, hihi," replied Littletato.<br />
"I love you so much love," said Júlia, happy with the hug.<br />
"I love you so much too love," said Littletato, also happy.<br />
It was raining gently, very good weather for sleeping, a little cold.<br />
Then the girls slept in the cool night, cuddling in bed.

		It was a Monday, Littletato woke up and yawned, she had to get ready for work.<br />
She looked at the clock and it was six in the morning, Júlia was still sleeping.<br />
Littletato came to the kitchen to prepare breakfast.<br />
She walked close to the window and saw the beautiful sunrise, then took a picture of it with her phone.<br />
<br />
She finished preparing breakfast, walked to the bedroom, and tried to wake up Júlia.<br />
Júlia woke up and hugged Littletato tight, caressing her hair.<br />
She kissed Littletato in her lips and smiled.<br />
"I love you, honey, you're so cute," said Júlia to Littletato.<br />
"I love you too my cutie, my little flower," replied her, that caressed Júlia's hair.<br />
"Let's go eat breakfast, hon," said Littletato.<br />
<br />
They both walked to the kitchen and sat at the table.<br />
The couple felt the warm sun touch their skins.<br />
Littletato and Júlia smiled while looking at each other.<br />
They were drinking hot chocolate and eating slices of bread with butter.<br />
<br />
Júlia and Littletato finished eating and Littletato walked to the bedroom to prepare herself for work.<br />
She was ready, they both walked to the front door, Júlia hugged Littletato tight.<br />
"See you later, hon," says Júlia, that gives a kiss in the lips of Littletato.<br />
"See you," says Littletato, who returns the kiss.<br />
<br />
Littletato opens the door and waves goodbye to Júlia while smiling, she waves back, Littletato starts to walk to her job.<br />
She puts on her earphones and puts a song to play on her phone, on the Vegetify app, it is a song of the Dubstep genre.<br />
Then she continues to walk to work while listening to the song.<br />
The girl looks at the trees and nature, the people walking around and the morning in the city.<br />
She thinks that it is so beautiful, human nature, the stars, the universe.<br />
Littletato likes to think about the unknown, about science, discovering new things.<br />
<br />
After walking a little, she arrives at her workplace and enters it.<br />
She pauses the song and removes her earphones, then walks to her desk.<br />
Littletato turns her computer on and says "Hi" to some co-workers.<br />
The computer turns on and Littletato opens her text editor.<br />
Her boss sends a message to her through a messaging program that the company where Littletato works created.<br />
The boss says that she needs to make the typing part of a smartphone messaging app.<br />
She sends to Littletato a text file saying how the typing part needs to be made.<br />
Littletato receives it and reads, then she starts programming the typing part.<br />
<br />
Then after some time typing and coding, Littletato finishes the part of the app.<br />
She sends the file with the code to her boss.<br />
Her boss tests the code file to see if it works, it does.<br />
Then her boss sends a message through the company's messaging program.<br />
The message says, "Hey Littletato, can you fix this part here? the part where the user types the message text, it's a bit small, can you enlarge it, also paint it white and give it a gray border?"<br />
<br />
Littletato replies positively and continues to work on the code.<br />
She finishes it and sends it again to her boss, she checks it and says that it is good.<br />
Then Littletato starts to fix some bugs (errors) in another app that the company needs to make.<br />
<br />
After sometime coding, working time ends.<br />
Littletato sends the debugged (fixed) code file to her boss and turns off the computer.<br />
She takes her things and gets up from her desk, then leaves the building and starts walking home.<br />
While walking, she sees the lights of the city and the lamp poles.<br />
She thinks about how people can get together and know each other, Littletato loves to study human nature.<br />
<br />
She thinks that she needs to buy some food and starts to walk to the supermarket.<br />
Littletato arrives there and walks to the supermarket shelves.<br />
She gets a shopping cart, walks to the snack part of the market, and grabs a pack of Doritos.<br />
The girl walks to some refrigerators, opens one of them, and takes a bottle of Coca-cola.<br />
Then she puts it inside the cart and walks to the cashier, she pays and grabs the bags, then starts to walk home again.<br />
<br />
Then she arrives at home and knocks on the door.<br />
Júlia opens and gives a big hug in Littletato, smiling happily and saying, "You're here honey!"<br />
Littletato kisses Júlia in her lips and smiles, then says, "I'm back, my baby".<br />
<br />
They enter inside the house and Júlia locks the door.<br />

Júlia goes there and hugs Littletato.<br />
The couple goes to the kitchen and Júlia starts to prepare dinner with the help of Littletato.<br />
<br />

Littletato said that she bought a bottle of Coca-cola, she takes the bottle out of the fridge and fills two glasses, one for Júlia and one for her.<br />
They eat dinner while drinking Coca-cola.<br />
Then the couple goes to the living room and turns on the television.<br />
<br />
They open the app called Vegeflix and put up "Captain Vegerica: Vegetable War" to watch.<br />
The couple starts to watch while drinking some Coca-cola and eating the pack of Doritos that Littletato bought.<br />
They get glazed in the movie and keep cheering for the characters they like, they love to see the special effects and the powers of the heroes.<br />
Júlia says she likes the Black Vegenther, Littletato says she likes the Black Vegwidow.<br />
Júlia lays her head on Littletato's lap and she keeps caressing Júlia's hair.<br />
<br />
After a few hours of watching and eating, the film ends.<br />
Júlia and Littletato feel a little tired, they turn off the television.<br />
Littletato goes to the kitchen and puts the bottle of Coca-cola inside the fridge.<br />
Then she puts the empty Doritos pack inside the trash bin.<br />
<br />
They walk to the bedroom, Littletato lies on the bed and Júlia lies down next to her.<br />
Littletato kisses Júlia in her lips and smiles while caressing her hair.<br />
"Your hair is so soft love, I love to pet it," says her.<br />
"Thanks, my dear, I love when you pet me like this, it makes me feel so special," replies Júlia.<br />
"Hehe, I love you my little sweet potato," says Littletato.<br />

		<h4 id="chapter_9_text" class="text_size unselectable " style="text-align: left;">
		It was a Tuesday, Littletato was dreaming of a field, a big and tall wheat field with a sunrise, she looked close to the sun and smiled.<br />
A heavy wind hit her and she tried not to fall, she felt great there, and calm, feeling the wind and nature, she loved to see nature in all of its forms.<br />
She started to walk close to an old house, then noticed that she was at a farm, the house was made of red bricks and had some wooden parts, the door was falling and almost completely broken.<br />
<br />
Littletato walked close to there and entered the house, she lighted up a candle and looked at all the items in the little house.<br />
There were shovels, hoes, seeds, and fertilizers, she got out of the house and saw that a storm was coming, the wind was very heavy and the trees were swinging a lot.<br />
She grabbed a large barrel and climbed up in a box, she placed the barrel on top of the roof.<br />
Then Littletato walked inside the house and saw that there was a refrigerator in there, she opened it and grabbed a can of Coca-cola.<br />
After that, she grabbed a chair and laid it on the ground, outside of the house, she sat there and drank her Coca-cola while waiting for the storm to come.<br />
Littletato looked at the storm and finished drinking her Coca-cola, she closed her eyes and relaxed in the chair.<br />
<br />
After some time, she felt some water drops on her arm, then opened her eyes and saw that it was starting to rain very hard, she quickly picked up her chair and walked inside the house.<br />
She left the chair there and closed her window, then sat at the chair and contemplated the beautiful rain, shaking all the trees with the wind, watering them all, watering her wheat field.<br />
Littletato liked to have that farm, it felt so nice and quiet, so relaxing and calming.<br />
<br />
She had a bed in there too, she wore some light clothes and laid on her bed.<br />
Littletato slept on her bed while listening to the sounds of the rain, making her sleep well.<br />
<br />
Littletato woke up and noticed that she was hugging Júlia, she looked at the clock and saw that it was six in the morning, then gave a quick kiss on the lips of Júlia.<br />
She woke up Júlia and walked to the kitchen with her, they hugged and looked at the sunrise, it was very beautiful, some birds were singing in the trees.<br />
They both walked to the bathroom to do their morning needs.<br />
After that, Júlia walked to the kitchen to prepare breakfast, she finished preparing it and she called Littletato to the kitchen.<br />
Littletato was combing her hair, she said "Coming, baby," while looking at the mirror, then she continued combing her hair.<br />
She walked to the kitchen and sat at the table in front of Júlia, they started eating.<br />
Júlia had made eggs with bacon and hot chocolate.<br />
"It is very good, hon, thanks," said Littletato, smiling at Júlia.<br />
"Thanks, honey, I'm happy that you liked it," replied Júlia.<br />
<br />
They finished eating and Littletato got up.<br />
She walked to her room to prepare for her job.<br />
Littletato was sat in her bed, putting on her socks, Júlia walked there and hugged Littletato.<br />
They both smiled and Littletato gave a kiss on the lips of Júlia.<br />
"I love you, hon, I miss you when you go to work," says Júlia in a sad tone.<br />
"Oh, I love you too, hon, I miss you when I'm at work too," says Littletato, that hugs Júlia tight.<br />
"Hmm... But it's okay, cause I'll see you after work, and I'll have you all to myself, hehe," replies her while smiling.<br />
"Hehe, yes, I'll be all yours," says Littletato while smiling naughtily.<br />
<br />
Then she gets up and gets her bag to go to work.<br />
She walks to the front door and Júlia follows her.<br />
Littletato gets out and hugs Júlia, giving a long kiss on her lips.<br />
Then she starts to walk to her job.<br />
She puts a rock playlist to play on her phone, using the Vegetify app.<br />
<br />
Júlia is at home, she locks the door and walks to the kitchen.<br />
Then she grabs a pack of Doritos and a can of Coca-cola that was hidden somewhere in the fridge.<br />
She walks to the bedroom and sits on a chair, in front of the chair there is a table and on top of the table, there is the laptop of Júlia.<br />
Júlia opens her laptop and turns it on, then leaves her Doritos pack and can of Coca-cola on top of the bed.<br />
<br />
She opens the Vegewitch.tv website and opens a Livestream of the streamer called "Patife".<br />
He is playing the game Call of Vegeduty: Vegetablezone with his friend Funky Vegetable Cat.<br />
It is a game of the first-person shooter type, the objective is to be the last one alive, and there are teams of players.<br />
There is also a gas that comes from the border of the map to kill the player, forcing them to come closer to each other and fight.<br />
Júlia opens her pack of Doritos and the can of Coca-cola.<br />
Then she starts to watch the Livestream while drinking and eating.<br />
<br />
Patife is playing, he runs to a place to hide when the gas comes and the area gets narrower.<br />
Then Funky Vegetable Cat says that there is an enemy close to the red mark that he made on the map.<br />
Patife looks in the direction where Funky marked and tries to shoot there with his long-range sniper.<br />
With luck, he takes one guy down, then he runs inside a house and opens some boxes to grab items, money, and some guns.<br />
He gets a car and Funky enters inside it, Patife starts to drive away from the gas and close to the safe zone.<br />
Then Patife stops the car and gets out of it, hiding right after.<br />
There are few players alive, and they are close to Patife because he is in the area of the safe zone.<br />
Júlia gets glazed up looking at the game, she smiles and gets excited, banging her feet on the ground.<br />
Patife gets inside a house and goes to the second floor, Funky is on the ground.<br />
He marks an enemy with a green marker, Patife sees it and shoots there with his sniper.<br />
Patife kills one enemy and looks to the other window, then a player appears behind him and kills him quickly with two pistols.<br />
He gets a little angry, saying that he did not hear the enemy coming, Funky quickly goes inside the house and kills the enemy.<br />
Then he walks outside and tries to run to a box to revive Patife.<br />
Funky is trying to revive Patife in the box but gets killed from behind.<br />
He gets angry and they both leave the match.<br />
Then Júlia opens the Livestream of Cellbit, he is playing a riddle game again, she watches it while drinking and eating.<br />
<br />
After some time, Júlia gets tired and yawns a little, her phone vibrates, showing that she got a message from someone on the Vegesapp app.<br />
It is a message from Vitória, she clicks the message and Vegesapp opens, she lowers the volume of the Livestream of Cellbit that is ending.<br />
Then she sees the message, it is a picture of barbecue meat.<br />
Júlia replies to the message saying, "That looks delicious, sis! I wish I was there with you to eat that 😋".<br />
"Hehe, maybe I could go there to make some barbecue for you sis 😊", replies Vitória.<br />
Then Júlia replies with a message, saying, "Oh, I would love that ^^".<br />
Júlia turns off the screen of her phone and lays it on the table, she closes the Livestream and opens a Livestream of songs of the Future Bass genre on Vegetube.<br />
She eats some Doritos and takes some sips of Coca-cola.<br />
Then grabs her phone and lies on the bed.<br />
She leaves the pack of Doritos and the can of Coca-cola on top of a table close to the bed.<br />
Júlia starts to play a game on her phone while listening to the Future Bass Livestream and eating Doritos sometimes.<br />
<br />
Then, after playing a lot, Júlia closes the game and finishes eating the pack of Doritos, the can of Coca-cola is already empty.<br />
Júlia closes the browser and turns off the laptop, then closes it.<br />
She goes to the kitchen and throws the pack of Doritos and the can of Coca-cola inside the trash bin.<br />
Then she walks to the living room and lies on the couch.<br />
Júlia turns the television on and leaves on a channel, playing, she stays fiddling with her cell phone.<br />
After some time, Littletato gets home, Júlia gets up and goes to the front door, opens it, and hugs Littletato tight.<br />
"You're home!, honey, I love to see you back," says Júlia.<br />
"I'm here honey, don't worry my dear, I'm all yours now," says Littletato in a calm voice while caressing the hair of Júlia.<br />
"Hehe, I'm happy, I love when you pat me, hon," replies Júlia.<br />
<br />
They both get inside and Littletato changes herself.<br />
Júlia prepares the dinner and eats along with Littletato.<br />
Littletato asks, "What did you do today, love?"<br />
"Nothing much, I just watched two Livestreams, one from Patife and another one from Cellbit," replies her.<br />
"Did you ate something delicious?" asks Littletato.<br />
"No, I-I just ate some bread with butter and stuff," replies Júlia while trying to hide the fact that she ate Doritos and Coca-cola.<br />
"Oh, it's good too," says Littletato.<br />
<br />
After eating, they walk to the bedroom, it is already night.<br />
They lie on the bed and Littletato hugs Júlia from behind, they cover themselves with the blanket.<br />
Littletato gives a kiss on the neck of Júlia, she giggles a little.<br />
"Good night, hon, I love you," says Littletato to Júlia.<br />
"Good night, honey, I love you too, my little potato," replies her.<br />
Then they sleep, waiting for the next day.

		<h4 id="chapter_10_text" class="text_size unselectable " style="text-align: left;">
		It was a Wednesday, Littletato was sleeping and dreaming.<br />
She was dreaming of a dream where she was lying on a cloud while looking at the sun, Júlia was at her side.<br />
The cloud was pink and was high in the sky, Littletato looked down and saw the cities and buildings from up there.<br />
She did not have a fear of falling even if it was so high.<br />
Suddenly, a man sitting on a white cloud appeared there with an acoustic guitar.<br />
His cloud was moving a little slow and he started to sing in Mexican while playing his acoustic guitar.<br />
He said his name was Miguel and he continued to sing.<br />
Júlia and Littletato thought that was so romantic, to hear him sing that song.<br />
Miguel said it was a song about his great-grandmother.<br />
"Remember me...<br />
Though I have to say goodbye<br />
Remember me<br />
Don't let it make you cry," sang him while playing his acoustic guitar.<br />
Littletato and Júlia were touched and little tears fell from their eyes.<br />
Then Miguel has gone away while sitting in his cloud.<br />
<br />
After that, another cloud appeared there, it was a wide orange cloud and there was a stage on top of it with large loudspeakers.<br />
The cloud moved to the front of Júlia and Littletato then stopped moving.<br />
A boy appeared there with an electric guitar, jamming it, he was in the middle of the stage.<br />
He said his name was Mizaque, but made it clear that it was with Z.<br />
Mizaque began playing his electric guitar, he was playing a Dubstep song with his guitar.<br />
Júlia thought that it was amazing, "How could an electric guitar play Dubstep sounds?" thought her.<br />
Mizaque was playing the Dubstep song and was close to the drop, that was the chorus of the song, the most exciting part.<br />
He played the guitar and sang like "Weeeeum, byoou byoou Twa!, weeeeum, tutututututututu, bwaaaaa, gwah! gwah! bwaaaaaa".<br />
Littletato loved that, even if he looked a little crazy, waving his head to the beat of the song.<br />
Then Mizaque ran away with his orange cloud to play more songs for other people.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Júlia felt like they were in an allegorical presentation, a lot of people doing things, and both of them watching it.<br />
Then a white cloud moved close to there with nothing on top of it, the couple thought that it was weird.<br />
After that, a fridge fell from space making a falling sound, it landed on the cloud without breaking or going through the cloud.<br />
A girl with gray hair appeared on top of the fridge, opened it, and grabbed a can of Coca-cola, she said "TPF, the Thought-Powered Fridge for your dreams".<br />
Littletato thought that it was an advertisement for a fridge or something.<br />
"Oops," the gray-haired girl looked at her un-existing clock, "I have to go back to my LonelyShip, bye-bye!" said her while smiling and waving her hand, she flew away in her cloud.<br />
<br />
Then a boy appeared in a cloud, he had his back to the couple, he was using his computer with his headphones.<br />
The boy said "I'm Teuqazi," he was looking at his screen and writing a story on a website called Littlegrape, it was a purple website that he made.<br />
Teuqazi was listening to some Dubstep songs on his computer while writing.<br />
He was smiling a lot, humming the bass of the song.<br />
The boy got up, removed his earphones, and walked close to a blue fridge, "TPF" was written on the fridge door.<br />
Teuqazi opened the door and picked up a can of Coca-cola from the fridge, then walked to his computer and sat at the chair again.<br />
He opened the Vegecord program on his computer and said "How boring..."<br />
Then he opened the Vegewitter website and said "How boring!"<br />
And then opened the Vegetube website and said "How boring!!!"<br />
After that, he received a message on Vegecord, he went to see who it was, it was a very good friend of his.<br />
He smiled and opened the notification to talk with that person.<br />
Littletato and Júlia were happy looking at the boy, they felt his happiness.<br />
<br />
Littletato woke up and looked at Júlia, she kissed Júlia's lips.<br />
She remembered the song that the Mexican man was singing, the boy playing his electric guitar, the gray-haired girl, and the boy writing a story on his computer.<br />
The girl thought that it was a really weird dream.<br />
"How could a fridge fall on a cloud and not pass through it?<br />
It's only a dream, I shouldn't worry about that," thought her.<br />
She looked at the ceiling and thought that she had to go to work, but needed to have breakfast first.<br />
Littletato removed the blanket that was covering her and kissed Júlia's forehead.<br />
She got up and walked to the bathroom, looking at the mirror and seeing her messy hair, she washed her face.<br />
The girl sighed and started to brush her teeth, after that, she used some floss and combed her hair.<br />
<br />
Then she walked to the kitchen and prepared breakfast, making two sandwiches with eggs, cheese, and mayonnaise.<br />
Littletato picked up two cups and filled them with milk and chocolate powder.<br />
She mixed the chocolate powder with the milk.<br />
The girl walked to the bedroom and lied on the bed, hugging Júlia tight.<br />
"I love you, honey," said her, kissing Júlia's cheek.<br />
Júlia grumbled a little and smiled, still sleeping, she turned to face Littletato and kissed her lips.<br />
"I love you too, my sunshine," said Júlia while smiling.<br />
"Let's have breakfast, baby," said Littletato to Júlia.<br />
"Okay, honey," replied her.<br />
Júlia yawned and stretched out, breaking out from the hug and getting up.<br />
She walked to the bathroom.<br />
"I'll wait for you at the kitchen, hon," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay, hon," said Júlia.<br />
She washed her face, brushed her teeth, and used floss.<br />
Then she walked to the kitchen and sat at the table, in front of Littletato.<br />
They started to eat breakfast.<br />
"It's very good, sweetie, thanks," said Júlia while eating her sandwich.<br />
"I'm happy that you appreciate it, hon," said Littletato as she smiled at Júlia.<br />
<br />
They finished eating breakfast, Júlia got up and walked to the living room, she sat on the couch and turned the television on.<br />
Littletato came there and kissed Júlia's lips.<br />
"I have to go to work, honey," said Littletato to Júlia.<br />
"Okay, baby," replied her.<br />
"I love you so much my baby, cutie," said Littletato, who hugged Júlia tight.<br />
"I love you too, hon," replied her.<br />
Then Littletato walked to the bedroom and started preparing herself to work.<br />
She walked to the front door and Júlia walked there too, Littletato hugged Júlia tight and kissed her lips, saying goodbye.<br />
Júlia said goodbye back and smiled at Littletato.<br />
Littletato started walking to work while listening to her favorite playlist of country music on her Vegetify app.<br />
<br />
Júlia locked the front door and walked to the kitchen, she drank her whole bottle of water and filled it up again.<br />
Then she walked to the living room and sat on the couch, looking at the television, her phone by her side.<br />
She felt a little tired and laid on the couch, putting her arm below the pillow.<br />
An advertisement appeared on the television, it had a man saying things.<br />
<br />
"Are you tired of your boring life? are you tired of working a full day and doing nothing fun?<br />
Well, if the answer is yes, then I got the right thing to you, come live at the <br />

A network of spaceships where you can live happily without having to work at all!<br />
It features a super-fast computer, a fridge that can create any food you think of;<br />
And a laser gun!<br />
Call now to win a free spaceship only for you!" said the man.<br />
Then the advertisement ended.<br />
Júlia thought: "What? this must be fake... how they can give a free spaceship to someone? how they're gonna get people inside that spaceship?<br />
A fridge that creates anything you think of? I can't believe that..."<br />
She lowered the volume of the television and closed her eyes to sleep.<br />
Júlia was thinking about Littletato, she was sleeping while smiling.<br />
She had good dreams while sleeping in the afternoon.

		It was a Thursday, Littletato was dreaming of pizzas, a lot of pizzas flying in the sky while she was sat on the surface of a desert.<br />
The sun was not too hot, it was a little chill there, the breeze was a little cold, she liked the weather.<br />
The girl noticed that she had wings, white wings made of feathers.<br />
Littletato flew high in the sky and ate some flying pizzas of pepperoni, they were delicious and moved like birds flapping their wings as they flew, she was smiling.<br />
The sky had candies too, flying candies, chocolate stuffed biscuits, gums, sodas to drink.<br />
She thought that she would become fat if she ate all of those things, there were so many of them, it was like the desert of food.<br />
<br />
Then the dream switched to another dream, she was driving a red car to Texas with Júlia, Littletato was happy to do a trip with Júlia.<br />
The car was convertible and the wind was hitting their hairs, Júlia put her hand outside of the car to feel the wind.<br />
Littletato put to play some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRejhGxr69Y" target="_blank">folk songs</a> on the music player that the car had, they both sang the songs, they were so relaxing.<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRejhGxr69Y" target="_blank" class="text_light_salmon text_hover_light_salmon">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRejhGxr69Y</a><br />
Júlia had mobile data on her phone and she sent a message to Vitória saying that she was on a trip with Littletato.<br />
Vitória said: "Send me pictures when you arrive there! 😊".<br />
Then Júlia replied: "Of course sis! ^^".<br />
Júlia started looking to the highway again, she looked at Littletato and smiled, Littletato smiled back.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
After some time has passed, it was afternoon, they were listening to a calmer song of the folk songs play-list.<br />
Littletato closed the roof of her red convertible car and relaxed on her seat.<br />
Júlia hugged Littletato and kissed her cheek, Littletato smiled and kissed back.<br />
They had stopped in a nearby city and bought some things to eat if they became hungry, Júlia opened the pack of Doritos and began eating.<br />
Littletato asked for one and opened her mouth, then Júlia put one on her mouth, Littletato ate it.<br />
Then Júlia opened a can of Coca-cola and drank a little, giving it to Littletato.<br />
Júlia thought that the trip was so relaxing, listening to songs and eating, looking at the beautiful view.<br />
Littletato was very happy, she arrived at a city that she needed to pass through before arriving in Texas.<br />
She arrived at the entrance of the city and paid the toll, then started driving around the city.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato woke up, she looked at Júlia and hugged her tight, kissing her lips.<br />
The birds were singing outside, she remembered the song that Júlia and she were listening to in the car.<br />
She looked at the clock and noticed it was six in the morning.<br />
Littletato got up and turned the television on.<br />
An ad for the TPF fridge was on television, saying that if you were a citizen of the SpaceLiving Network, you could use the TPF fridge on your house.<br />
Littletato turned the volume of the television down and walked to the bathroom to do her morning needs.<br />
She brushed her teeth, used some floss, and combed her hair.<br />
Then she walked to the kitchen and prepared breakfast, it was eggs with bacon and hot chocolate.<br />
<br />
Littletato walked to the living room and opened the Vegeflix app on the television, she chose the Atypical series to watch on Vegeflix.<br />
She left the series paused and walked to the bedroom, waking up Júlia with a kiss and a hug.<br />
Júlia woke up and said to Littletato "I love you", Littletato said it back.<br />
Then Júlia walked to the bathroom to do her morning needs, after that, she walked to the kitchen and saw the meal on top of the table.<br />
"It looks so delicious hon!" said Júlia while smiling, looking at the food.<br />
"Thanks, hon, I'm happy that you like it," replied Littletato smiling.<br />
Littletato and Júlia walked to the living room to eat breakfast while watching one episode of the Atypical series.<br />
They think this series is so fun to watch, it is a teen series, they enjoy watching it.<br />
<br />
After some time eating, they finished both the meal and the episode of Atypical.<br />
Littletato kissed Júlia's lips and said that she needed to go to work.<br />
She walked to the bedroom and started preparing herself for work.<br />
Júlia hugged her tight and kissed her cheek, Littletato kissed her back.<br />
Littletato then walked to the living room door and opened it, she hugged Júlia tight and kissed Júlia's lips again.<br />
"Hey honey, I think I'm going for a ride with my bike today, I'm gonna lock the house okay?" said Júlia.<br />
"Okay hon, when are you going to arrive?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think I'll be here by noon if I can handle riding my bike a lot, hehe," replied Júlia.<br />
"Oh, okay, good ride, honey," said Littletato while smiling.<br />
"Thanks, good luck at work," said Júlia as she hugged Littletato.<br />
They both waved goodbye to each other, Littletato started walking to work while listening to some folk songs on her phone.<br />
<br />
Júlia came back inside the house and drank some water because she was thirsty.<br />
Then she walked to the living room and grabbed the house's key, she also grabbed a backpack.<br />
She grabbed the key of her bicycle and moved her bicycle outside, locking the house.<br />
Júlia started riding her bicycle around the city, she stored the key of the house inside her pocket.<br />
She wanted to go to a park in the city, she knew that there were a lot of people exercising there.<br />
Júlia continued riding her bike and arrived there.<br />
She started circling the block, going fast while looking at the trees.<br />
The girl liked to ride her bicycle sometimes, it was good to refresh her mind, to calm herself, and stop thinking about the problems.<br />
Júlia brought her wallet with her, she got out of the park and started riding to a market.<br />
When she arrived there, Júlia parked her bike in a bike parking lot, locking her bike.<br />
<br />
She walked inside the market, bought a cold can of Coca-cola, and a packet of Doritos.<br />
Júlia got out of the market and unlocked her bicycle.<br />
She started riding to another park that she knew in San Francisco, it had birds and lots of animals.<br />
Some people would go there to do a picnic, it had a beautiful and crystal clear river.<br />
Júlia arrived there and parked her bike on a tree, locking it.<br />
She saw some people sat on the ground, some with their children, some with friends, it was a good park to relax.<br />
Júlia sat on the grass, opened her can of Coca-cola, and her packet of Doritos.<br />
Some kids were running around, there was a brown dog too.<br />
She picked up her phone and put some relaxing music to play while drinking Coca-cola and eating Doritos.<br />
Suddenly, a kid walked close to her, looking at her Doritos packet, Júlia paused the music, he asked for her to give him a little.<br />
She gave a little to him and he said thanks while smiling, walking back to his parents, eating the Doritos.<br />
Júlia smiled back and put her music to play again, relaxing while eating and drinking.<br />
She finished eating her packet of Doritos and drinking her Coca-cola can.<br />
It was really good to hear the birds singing and the sound of the water flowing in the river.<br />
She laid on the ground, looking at the sky and the clouds while listening to some good ambient music.<br />
Thinking about her life, about Littletato, Vitória, Iam, other friends that she had.<br />
Júlia was smiling, she was calm and reflective, looking at the clouds moving, feeling the breeze.<br />
Feeling the weight of her body, and feeling all of her problems going away.<br />
She closed her eyes and began to sleep, listening to the song, and feeling nature.<br />
<br />
Júlia woke up and noticed that the music has ended, she got up and locked the screen of her phone, storing the earphones and her smartphone inside her backpack.<br />
She grabbed the shopping bag and put the empty Doritos packet and the empty can of Coca-cola inside it.<br />
Then she walked to a near trash bin and dropped the bag inside it.<br />
Júlia walked close to her bicycle and unlocked it, then she started to ride back home.<br />
She stopped and grabbed her phone from the backpack, looking at the hours.<br />
It was eleven o'clock in the morning, she stored her phone inside the backpack again and continued to ride back home.<br />
<br />
She decided to grab her phone again a put to play a good song of the folk genre on it to listen to while she traveled back home.<br />
Júlia started riding her bike again while looking at the scenario and nature, the trees and grass, the beautiful sun, the girl loved nature.<br />
She arrived home and unlocked the house, storing her bicycle inside it.<br />
Then she locked the front door and left the bicycle's key on the key holder of the house.<br />
She walked to the kitchen, drank a whole bottle of water, and ate an apple, she was a little tired.<br />
Júlia walked to the living room and laid on the couch, turning on the television.<br />
She closed her eyes and slept on the warm noon, waiting for Littletato to come from work.

		It was a Friday, Littletato was dreaming of cookies, she ate a lot of them.<br />
She asked herself why she always had food dreams, maybe it is because she loved eating stuff.<br />
Littletato was eating cookies, she was sat on a throne, looking at a pile of gold.<br />
She thought that she was a queen or a princess, some royal person.<br />
There was a giant pile of cookies in front of her, she could eat every cookie.<br />
Littletato was wearing a wool coat, it was a stylish thing to wear.<br />
She was known as "The queen of eating" or "The queen of the cookies" because she ate and produced a lot of cookies.<br />
Littletato could press a button and it would make cookies for her.<br />
There were also grandmothers, farms, mines, factories, and portals that produced cookies for her.<br />
Her cookie factory was known everywhere in the world, she was very famous for making cookies.<br />
The TV news was flooded with the news about her and her cookie factory, she was a very good cookie maker.<br />
After some years, cookies became the new currency and people threw the old paper money away.<br />
<br />
Then another dream came in, Littletato was driving on a highway with a car that had some purple neon on its sides.<br />
The car's radio was playing a track of the Synth wave genre, Littletato liked to feel the wind on her hair, she liked to listen to the song while driving on the highway.<br />
There were a lot of people on the highway too, driving their cars, Littletato looked at her car and thought that it was a Delorean.<br />
A fast car passed by her, it was a car with red neon on its sides, it looked like a car from a rebel group that tried to fight for freedom in the city where Littletato was.<br />
That group fought for freedom and freedom of speech, they did not agree with the city's governor's choice of monitoring the population.<br />
Littletato stepped on the car's accelerator and came face to face with the person inside the red neon car.<br />
The person lowered the car window, it was a girl that had red LEDs on her hair, she looked punk, and had purple eye makeup on her eyes.<br />
"Hey, you're new here, right? Wanna join our group?" asked the girl.<br />
"What your group is about?" asked Littletato.<br />
"We fight for freedom and fight to deactivate the surveillance system that exists in the city, the governor created it to monitor people's life.<br />
We don't want that, we want freedom and privacy, we have good hackers on our side," said her.<br />
"Oh, that sounds cool, what is your name?" asked Littletato while driving fast, following the red neon car.<br />
"My name is Mika, what's yours?" asked the red LED girl.<br />
"Littletato, nice to meet you Mika," said Littletato.<br />
"Nice to meet you too, Littletato," said Mika, smiling.<br />
Then Littletato drove together with Mika, they arrived at the headquarters of "The Underdogs", the rebel group of Mika.<br />
<br />
After that, the dream switched to another dream, Littletato was feeling very calm inside that dream, she felt happy and relaxed.<br />
She was seeing a beautiful castle of glass, it was transparent and you could see the things inside it, it was really beautiful.<br />
Behind the castle of glass was a wonderful blue sky and some white clouds, it was like Littletato was high in the sky, close to the clouds.<br />
Littletato could look at the sun and see it paint the clouds yellow, see it pass through the clouds.<br />
The castle of glass was empty, but Littletato did not felt lonely or sad, she was happy for being in such a good and relaxing place.<br />
It was like the castle was traveling on top of the clouds, that the clouds were holding it.<br />
Littletato could fly in the sky even if she had no wings, she began flying close to the castle and landed close to its door.<br />
Its door was big and tall, Littletato pushed the door and it opened, she started walking inside the castle.<br />
The castle of glass had various beautiful chandeliers with a lot of colorful jewels hanging on them.<br />
Littletato thought that it was very beautiful, seeing all those amazing chandeliers with red, pink, purple, white, black, blue, green, yellow, and grey jewels hanging on them.<br />
She could see the sunlight coming inside the castle of glass and forming a rainbow inside it.<br />
Her eyes shone with amazement and astonishment, Littletato was in a very beautiful place.<br />
The castle of glass was really big, she began walking inside it and opening all of its doors, she saw a library, a room with a bed and a wardrobe.<br />
And a dining room with a really wide table, the table was filled with slices of lemon cake on the plates and had bottles of Coca-cola close to a big cake that was on the end of the table.<br />
Littletato thought that there was a party going on there, even if there was no one nearby, she sat at a chair.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a purple alicorn pony appeared there in the dining room, she said that her name was Twilight Sparkle, and was surprised to see a human for the first time.<br />
(There goes me again inserting "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" in my stories xD.<br />
I love MLP: FIM, I can't help but put it in other things I love, which are my stories :3.)<br />
"Hello there, where do you come from?" asked Twilight Sparkle while looking at Littletato.<br />
Littletato was surprised at the sight of the little pony, she never saw a pony or an alicorn before, she looked at her wings and her horn.<br />
"Some minutes ago I just realized that I was floating in the sky close to a castle of glass, I could fly, so I began flying towards that castle.<br />
And I began exploring this castle and opening its doors, the chandeliers here are so beautiful.<br />
I already love this place even if I haven't spent much time in here," said Littletato while looking at the ceiling of the castle.<br />
"Oh, that's interesting, this castle floats high in the sky, so it is really hard for people to visit it or even know that it is real.<br />
So I don't know how you got in here, but... You can stay here if you want... By the way, what is your name?" asked Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"My name is Littletato, what is yours?" asked Littletato smiling lightly while looking at Twilight.<br />
"My name is Twilight Sparkle, so, you can fly right?" asked Twilight.<br />
"Yeah, I guess, can I show you?" asked Littletato, getting up from the chair.<br />
"Yes, please," said Twilight Sparkle.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato began floating towards the ceiling of the dining room like she was floating on the water.<br />
Twilight Sparkle was surprised by that, she used her magic to get Littletato on the floor again, her horn shone in purple.<br />
"My friends are gonna come here for a birthday party, do you wanna join us Littletato?" asked Twilight Sparkle, smiling at Littletato.<br />
"Of course!" said Littletato smiling, "Whose birthday is it?" asked her.<br />
"It's Dashie's birthday, Rainbow Dash, my friend," said Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Oh, can she create rainbows?" asked Littletato with her eyes shining with amazement.<br />
"Well... Yeah, I guess, when she flies fast she creates a sonic rainbow which is kind of like flying faster than the speed of light, then a rainbow appears behind her," said Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Wow, that's awesome," said Littletato putting her hands on her cheeks and smiling.<br />
"That's what she would say if she saw something awesome," said Twilight Sparkle while giggling a little.<br />
"So, I'm gonna read a book for thirty minutes to wait for my friends to arrive here okay?" asked Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Okay, can I sleep in here?" asked Littletato while looking at Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Of course, hehe, I think you're a good person.<br />
In fact, the first time I saw you here today I thought you were an alien," said Twilight Sparkle while giggling a little.<br />
"But I read in a book about the legend of the humans, creatures that were bipeds, creatures that walked on two legs and held things with their hands.<br />
So I was not so surprised of seeing you, I thought 'Oh, I finally saw a human in my life, they say that they are rare'," said Twilight Sparkle while smiling and looking at Littletato.<br />
<br />
"Come with me, I'm gonna show you your room, I always have a free room for guests," said Twilight Sparkle who began trotting to the stairs.<br />
Littletato followed her and they arrived at a door, Twilight opened the door and Littletato saw a room with a bed, wardrobe, and a writing desk.<br />
The girl entered the room and began walking inside it to familiarize herself with the room.<br />
"This is your room, have fun," said Twilight while smiling.<br />
"Oh, and another thing, the castle is not made of glass, it's just a spell that I use to keep ponies away from here and prevent pegasus from hitting the castle accidentally," said Twilight, who made her horn glow and turned on the colors of the castle.<br />
The castle was now opaque and you could see that it was made of crystals, Twilight Sparkle said to Littletato that a crystal tree was planted on the ground down there.<br />
Twilight Sparkle said that the tree grew and generated a crystal castle, that castle began flying and stopped flying when it reached the sky.<br />
And now they have a beautiful crystal castle to live inside and house all of their friends and stuff.<br />
<br />
Spike, the purple baby dragon assistant, and friend of Twilight Sparkle arrived, he walked upstairs while looking for Twilight.<br />
"Twilight? Twilight? Where are you?" asked him.<br />
"I'm up here Spike, at the guest's room," said Twilight Sparkle.<br />
Then Spike walked there and saw Littletato.<br />
"Who is she?" asked Spike.<br />
"She is my new friend, Littletato, she said that she just appeared close to the castle and she thought that it was a castle of glass.<br />
Then she began exploring the castle and looking at it, she is gonna stay here with us Spike," said Twilight Sparkle smiling.<br />
"Oh, okay, nice to meet you, Littletato," said Spike, walking close to Littletato and shaking her hand.<br />
Littletato shook the hand of Spike back and smiled, "Nice to meet you too, Spike".<br />
"Okay, I'm gonna read my comic book Twilight, tell me when the others arrive," said Spike, going downstairs and walking inside the library.<br />
"Okay Spike," said Twilight Sparkle before he left the room.<br />
"I'll tell you too when the girls arrive okay?" asked Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Okay, thanks Twilight," said Littletato smiling.<br />
"No problem, hehe," said Twilight Sparkle, who closed the door, trotted downstairs, and entered inside the library, getting a book with her horn magic and laying on the ground.<br />
<br />
Littletato laid on her bed and looked at the ceiling, smiling happily while feeling her current feelings and thinking about where she is right now.<br />
She thought that she was experiencing a lot of new things, new feelings.<br />
Littletato met new people, she met a purple pony alicorn who had wings, a horn, and magic.<br />
The girl closed her eyes, after some minutes she began sleeping, she woke up in yet another dream.<br />
Littletato woke up and smiled while remembering and thinking about the dreams she had.<br />
The dream about how she was a cookie producer and had a cookie company that dominated the world and made cookies the new currency.<br />
That dream of Synthwave stuff and the rebel group of Mika.<br />
And that awesome dream about the castle of glass that was not made of glass and there were a purple pony and a purple dragon inside and a birthday party was going to happen.<br />
Littletato thought about those three dreams, she wondered how her mind could create those dreams even if she did not know those people and those places.<br />
She thought that she was really traveling to those places when she dreamt, like astral projection.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 23/08/2018.<br />
I revised this chapter on 08/12/2020 while listening to my Future Bass playlist on YouTube.<br />
<br />
It was really good, I was really happy like I am every time that I write Littletato or other stories of mine.<br />
I also drank water while writing and revising this chapter uwu.<br />
Thank you for reading :3.<br />
<br />
Things that I wrote when I wrote a lot of stuff and I wanted to finish the chapter but these things down here would not be good for putting on the end of the chapter because they would start a new block of text, maybe in another chapter:<br />
<br />
Littletato then walked outside her room and turned off the light, she walked downstairs and entered the library.<br />
"Hey Twilight, I'm a little hungry, and the girls haven't arrived yet, can I eat something other than the cake?" asked Littletato, caressing her belly with her hand.<br />
"Of course, there is some bread in the kitchen, and some hayburguers, I don't know if you like that, since you're a human.<br />
But you can use the Food Generator that Izaque gave me, Izaque is a human too, he said that he was a New Worlder, a person that lived inside a New World universe.<br />
He said that the Food Generator was just a Thing Generator but configured to generate only edible stuff, so... Have fun," said Twilight Sparkle, smiling happily while wagging her tail.<br />
"Okay, thanks a lot Twilight," said Littletato smiling.<br />
"No problem Littletato, hehe," said Twilight Sparkle.<br />
Then Littletato started walking to the kitchen, she opened the fridge and grabbed a pack of milk.<br />
After that, Littletato closed the fridge and looked at the kitchen sink, there was a black cube there, maybe that was the Food Generator that Twilight talked about.)

		It was a Friday, before midnight, Littletato was dreaming, she was very calm inside her current dream, she felt happy and relaxed.<br />
She was seeing a beautiful castle of glass, it was transparent and you could see the things inside it, it was really beautiful.<br />
Behind the castle of glass was a wonderful blue sky and some white clouds, it was like Littletato was high in the sky, close to the clouds.<br />
Some minutes passed inside her dream, a lot of things happened, she was talking with an alicorn pony called Twilight Sparkle.<br />
The castle was not made of glass, it was opaque and Twilight Sparkle could use her horn magic to change the castle between its two modes, glass and opaque.<br />
Littletato met spike, the purple baby dragon assistant of Twilight Sparkle, he could spit fire through his mouth.<br />
Júlia was dreaming about a castle, she is sat on a very wide table, the part where she was sat had a big bowl of pink cupcakes.<br />
The rest of the table was filled with a mixture of sweet and savory, pies, cakes, coxinha, pastry, and other foods.<br />
She ate a cupcake, the taste of the cupcake reminded her of Pinkie Pie, a pink earth pony from My Little Pony who had a dark pink mane.<br />
Then a bed fell from the ceiling and landed on the ground close to Júlia.<br />
She got up and laid on the bed, then Júlia noticed that a small fridge was there, on the other side of the room.<br />
Júlia got up from the bed and walked close to the fridge, opening it and grabbing a can of Coca-cola.<br />
<br />
The girl looked at the door, it was a tall door, it was made of wood, dark wood just like the walls.<br />
The house looked like an old house from inside, a house of rich people.<br />
There were two big windows on the right of Júlia, she looked at them, they had beautiful white curtains.<br />
There was a light outside of the windows, a bright white light that did not let Júlia see past the windows.<br />
Júlia looked at the door again, the door opened, Pinkie Pie was behind the door, opening it.<br />
Pinkie Pie flew around the dining room even if she could not fly, yelling "Weeeeeeeeeee!"<br />
"Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie, and I threw this party just for you!" said Pinkie Pie, holding Júlia's hands with her hoofs.<br />
"Do you like the food?" asked Pinkie Pie, smiling.<br />
"Yes, it is pretty good, I ate only one cupcake actually, I know you from a cartoon called My Little Pony," said Júlia, smiling at her.<br />
"You only ate one cupcake?!" asked Pinkie Pie yelling, surprised, "I don't know what is a 'cartoon', what is it?" asked Pinkie Pie, curious.<br />
"Oh, it is... nothing, I know you from somewhere else than here, anyway, why you threw this party for me Pinkie Pie?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Because you're a good person, I know you, Júlia, and you're a caring person and good friend to me, you always help me," said Pinkie Pie, hugging Júlia tight.<br />
"Oh, thanks Pinkie Pie, I'm really happy that you think that," said Júlia, returning the hug while smiling.<br />
"But... I never met Pinkie Pie, how she is my friend?" thought Júlia, curious.<br />
"Anyway, are you gonna eat the food?" asked Pinkie Pie, breaking out from the hug while looking at the table and looking back at Júlia.<br />
"Yes, do you wanna eat with me? I don't think I can handle all that food," asked Júlia while giggling a little.<br />
"Yes, hehe, yay!" said Pinkie Pie, jumping happily on top of a chair and starting to eat some pies.<br />
Júlia made the same, they started to eat together, the food was very delicious.<br />
<br />
Then, after some time eating, Pinkie Pie and Júlia finished eating all of the food.<br />
"I'm gonna get some rest Júlia, my tummy hurts from so much food," said Pinkie Pie with her hoof on her belly.<br />
"If you need me I'm gonna be in my room upstairs okay?" said Pinkie Pie, starting to walking to the door, closing it, and walking upstairs.<br />
"Okay Pinkie Pie," said Júlia before Pinkie Pie left the dining room.<br />
Then Júlia walked to the small fridge, the letters "TPF" were written on the door of the fridge.<br />
Júlia grabbed a can of Coca-cola out of the fridge and started drinking it to relieve the pain in her tummy.<br />
She finished drinking the can and threw it inside the trash can that was there.<br />
After that, Júlia laid on the bed looking at the beautiful chandelier that was on the ceiling.<br />
She felt a little tired, Júlia closed her eyes and started to sleep.<br />
<br />
After some minutes, Júlia still had her eyes closed, she heard a familiar voice calling her.<br />
"Júlia... wake up, wake up... Hey, Júlia, wake up," said the voice.<br />
Júlia opened her eyes and everything was blurry, she started to see well again, she saw the same room with dark wood walls.<br />
In front of her was Littletato, telling her to wake up, and that the breakfast is ready.<br />
After that, she heard Littletato's voice more realistically.<br />
Júlia opened her eyes again, she woke up, it was not a dream anymore, her brain used the real voice of Littletato to create a dream.<br />
After some seconds, Júlia got up and hugged Littletato, Littletato kissed Júlia's lips and smiled, it was a Saturday.<br />
"I had a dream with Pinkie Pie, and after some minutes in that dream, I heard your voice call me to wake up cause breakfast was ready hon," said Júlia.<br />
"Oh, I think your brain used my voice as a dream 'fuel', my brain does that sometimes, it's good that I can wake you up more easily," said Littletato while giggling a little.<br />
"Hehe, I love you hon," said Júlia, kissing Littletato's lips.<br />
"I love you too my little potato," said Littletato, kissing Júlia's lips back.<br />
Then Júlia got up and walked to the bathroom, she started making her morning needs.<br />
<br />
Then the couple walked to the kitchen and started to eat breakfast, Littletato had made eggs with bacon.<br />
"Hey honey, today I dreamed about cookies, and a cookie factory, also about Twilight Sparkle and her crystal castle, it was very good," said Littletato while eating.<br />
"Oh, that sounds interesting hon, I dreamed with Pinkie Pie today, she is my favorite character of My Little Pony," said Júlia smiling, remembering the dream.<br />
"How was that dream hon?" asked Littletato, curious.<br />
"I noticed that I was sitting on the chair of a wide table, it had a lot of pink cupcakes and other foods, sweet and savory.<br />
Then I ate one cupcake, suddenly a bed fell from the ceiling and landed next to me, that was normal for me.<br />
There was a fridge on the other side of the room, I got up and walked close to it, opening it and grabbing a can of Coca-cola.<br />
Then Pinkie Pie appeared there and said that she made that party just for me, I was happy for her to be there, it was good to know her.<br />
The food was too much, I invited her to eat with me, she accepted and we ate a lot, our tummies hurt.<br />
Then I laid on the bed and slept, then I woke up in the dream and after that, in real life," explained Júlia while looking at Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that's very interesting honey, it was a really good dream," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Júlia.<br />
Then the couple finished eating, they walked to the living room to watch a movie.<br />
Littletato heard that a new movie was out on the Vegeflix app, the couple sat on the couch and Littletato turned on the Smart TV.<br />
After that, Littletato searched for the movie "The Vegengers: Infinite Vegetablewar" at Vegeflix.<br />
"My sister said that this movie is very good," said Júlia, looking at Littletato.<br />
"Oh, let's watch it then hon, do you want to post a picture of us and the movie on the Vegesapp status?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, let's do it hon," said Júlia smiling.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato pressed play on the movie and grabbed her smartphone, she paused the movie and took a selfie of her, Júlia, and the TV.<br />
Littletato posted that picture on her Vegesapp status, she sent the photo to Júlia so she could post it on her status too.<br />
Júlia posted the photo on her status, Vitória sent her a message on Vegesapp, she said that she is having fun with her boyfriend in New York.<br />
After that, Júlia replied to Vitória with some happy face emojis, Vitória said "Good movie sis!" to Júlia.<br />
"Thanks, sis! ^^" replied Júlia, Júlia said that she is having fun with Littletato.<br />
Vitória said that she is happy for Júlia, Júlia is also happy for her sister.<br />
Littletato asked who it was, Júlia said it was her sister, saying that Vitória was having fun with her boyfriend in New York.<br />
Then Littletato hugged Júlia tight and kissed her lips, smiling.<br />
After that, Littletato grabbed her smartphone, she sent a message to Carol, her sister, on Vegesapp, asking what she was doing on Saturday.<br />
Carol had blond hair, she said that she was just playing some Countable Vegestrike 1.6 and streaming it on Vegewitch.<br />
Littletato said that it was very interesting, she asked for the Livestream link so she could watch it after watching the movie.<br />
Carol sent the link of the stream to Littletato, Littletato said thanks with some happy face emojis, and said "Good game sis!"<br />
Then Carol asked what Littletato was doing on Saturday.<br />
Littletato said that she was watching a Marvel movie with her girlfriend Júlia.<br />
"What movie are you watching sis?" asked Carol.<br />
"I'm watching 'The Vegengers: Infinite Vegetablewar'," replied Littletato.<br />
"That's good, I still didn't watch it, I'm going to watch it after I finish my Livestream, good movie sis!" said Carol with some happy face emojis.<br />
"Thanks, sis, hehe ^^," replied Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato pressed play and relaxed on the couch, starting to watch the movie, the Marvel intro appeared on the screen.<br />
<br />
The movie showed the Marvel logo, starting, it showed the spaceship of Vegethor in space.<br />
A lot of Vegesgardians were dead on the spaceship, Vegebony Maw was walking among the corpses.<br />
Vegeheimdall was badly wounded, he reached out trying to stop Vegebony Maw as he passed, but he lacks the strength.<br />
Vegebony Maw stepped over the corpses with no mind as he spoke, as if they were scattered pieces of dirty clothing on a bedroom floor.<br />
"Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan... You may think this is suffering... no. It is salvation.<br />
Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile..." said Vegebony Maw, Corvus Glaive stabbed one of the lingering Vegesgardians, "For even in death, you have become Children of VegeThanos," continued Vegebony Maw.<br />
Loki stayed with the Black Order. He watched VegeThanos, shrouded in darkness and light, a vague silhouette.<br />
Some hours passed, the movie ended, Júlia and Littletato loved the movie.<br />
They were sad because of all the people that died at the hands of VegeThanos, just for universe balance, they wanted them to be revived.<br />
Júlia was sad because of Vegeter Parker that died, turning into ashes, Littletato was sad because of Mantis who turned into ashes.<br />
Littletato hugged Júlia tight and kissed her lips, the movie was marked as "Watched" in Littletato's profile of the Vegeflix app.<br />
The couple was tired, Littletato turned off the TV and they both walked to the bedroom.<br />
Júlia and Littletato laid on the bed, Littletato covered her and Júlia with the blanket, they closed their eyes and slept in the cold night, hugging tight.<br />

		It was a Sunday, in the year 2018, Littletato was working on her job on New Year's Eve, she could leave work early this day because of the New Year's Eve.<br />
Littletato then grabbed her things and said happy new year to her coworker Mia.<br />
She also stopped by her boss' room and wished a happy new year to her boss.<br />
After that, Littletato left the building, it was a cold day in San Francisco, there was water all around the roads.<br />
It was six in the afternoon.<br />
Littletato was using her dark brown coat, she had an umbrella inside her purse if she needed it.<br />
The girl started walking to her house, she was walking on the sidewalk.<br />
It started raining, Littletato opened her purse and grabbed her umbrella, she untied it and opened it.<br />
Then Littletato grabbed her smartphone from out of her purse and sent a message to Júlia saying that she was going to be a little late because she was going to stop at the supermarket.<br />
Júlia replied saying okay, Littletato stored her smartphone in her purse again and started walking to the supermarket.<br />
She arrived there and picked up a plastic basket and grabbed a Doritos pack, a bottle of 3,5 liters of Coca-cola, and a packet of chocolate stuffed biscuits.<br />
Then Littletato started walking to the supermarket cashier, she paid for the purchase and left the supermarket.<br />
After that, the girl continued walking home.<br />
<br />
She arrived at her house's door, grabbing the house's key from her pocket and opening it.<br />
Littletato entered the house and Júlia hugged her, saying "Welcome home (okaeri), honey," while smiling.<br />
Then Littletato kissed Júlia's lips, "I'm back, honey," then she walked to the kitchen and left the plastic bags with the food on top of the table.<br />
Júlia started opening the plastic bags and taking the things off them.<br />
"Oh, honey, you brought Doritos, I love them, for us to pass our New Year's Eve right?" asked Júlia, smiling while holding the Doritos packet.<br />
"Yes hon, I love it too, I also bought a big bottle of Coca-cola and a packet of chocolate stuffed biscuits," said Littletato, removing the Coca-cola bottle and the chocolate stuffed biscuits from the bags.<br />
Then Littletato placed the bottle of Coca-cola inside the fridge for it to get cold.<br />
She stored the Doritos packet and the chocolate stuffed biscuits packet inside the kitchen cabinet.<br />
"Let's prepare ourselves for New Year's Eve hon?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes hon, let's do it," replied Júlia.<br />
Then the couple walked to the bedroom and changed themselves, using white clothes for New Year's Eve.<br />
"I heard that there is going to be a big screen with the countdown to the new year downtown on New Year's Eve," said Júlia.<br />
"Oh, that sounds good, let's watch a little movie and we're going there at eleven pm okay?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay hon," replied Júlia.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato and Júlia walked to the living room, they sat on the couch.<br />
Littletato grabbed the TV controller and turned the TV on.<br />
She started looking at the catalog of Vegeflix looking for a movie to watch.<br />
(Vegeflix is a website and mobile app where you can watch series, movies, cartoons, and animes online, using a paid plan.)<br />
Júlia grabbed her smartphone and started sending messages to her friends wishing them a happy new year.<br />
She sent messages to her sister Vitória, to Littletato's sister Carol, to Iam, and her mother and father.<br />
They all replied, wishing Júlia a happy new year, Júlia also posted in her Vegesapp status wishing a happy new year to all of their contacts.<br />
(Vegesapp is an app that you can install on your smartphone, it lets you chat with people, you need a phone number and a SIM card to use it.)<br />
Littletato chose a movie for them to watch, it was called "The Vegengers: Vegend Game", it was a new superhero movie that launched recently.<br />
Then Littletato grabbed her smartphone, she posted on her Vegesapp status wishing a happy new year to everyone.<br />
After that, the girl sent messages to all of her friends wishing them a happy new year.<br />
She said happy new year to Júlia's sister Vitória, to her sister Carol, Iam, her coworker Mia, and her father and mother.<br />
Then Littletato walked to the kitchen, grabbed Júlia's water bottle, and walked to the living room, leaving it on top of the living room table at the right of the right arm of the couch.<br />
After that, Littletato kissed Júlia's lips and smiled, she walked to the kitchen and grabbed a bowl, opening the Doritos packet and throwing all of the Doritos inside the bowl.<br />
Littletato asked from the kitchen if Júlia wanted her to mix the Doritos and the chocolate stuffed biscuits on the bowl.<br />
Júlia replied saying yes, then Littletato opened the packet of biscuits and threw all of them inside the bowl.<br />
<br />
Littletato had a Styrofoam box, she placed a lot of ice cubes inside it, then she grabbed two cups made of glass.<br />
Then the girl grabbed the bottle of Coca-cola from inside the fridge's freezer and filled the two cups with Coca-cola.<br />
After that, Littletato walked to the living room, leaving the cup of Júlia next to her on the table at the right of the couch.<br />
She left her cup on the left table that was on the left part of the couch.<br />
Then Littletato placed the Coca-cola bottle inside the Styrofoam box filled with ice cubes so it does not get hot.<br />
Littletato walked to the kitchen and grabbed the bowl, she turned the lights off and walked back to the living room.<br />
After that, Littletato left the bowl of Doritos and chocolate stuffed biscuits between her and Júlia.<br />
Littletato grabbed the TV's controller and unpaused the movie, Júlia posted on her Vegesapp status saying that she was going to watch a movie with Littletato before New Year's Eve.<br />
Then Júlia blocked her smartphone's screen, she kissed Littletato's lips and smiled.<br />
The movie logo appeared, it was the Marvel Studios logo, the same company that made the "Vegeider-Tableman: Far From San Francisco" movie.<br />
Júlia grabbed some Doritos from the bowl and ate them, then she took a sip of her Coca-cola cup.<br />
Littletato grabbed one Doritos and one chocolate stuffed biscuit from the bowl, she ate both of them and took a sip of her Coca-cola cup.<br />
They continued watching the movie, the couple wanted to see the dead characters alive again, they were sad because they were gone.<br />
At the half of the movie, there was half of the Doritos, half of the chocolate stuffed biscuits, and half of the Coca-cola bottle of 3,5 liters.<br />
<br />
After watching for three hours, the movie ended, the food ended too, there was still some Coca-cola left in the bottle.<br />
Littletato grabbed the bowl and brought it to the kitchen, she left it below the sink's tap and opened the tap.<br />
Then she closed the tap and walked to the living room, sitting on the couch, Júlia grabbed the two cups and left them on top of the sink.<br />
Júlia then came back to the living room, "Wanna end the rest, honey?" asked Littletato looking at the Coca-cola bottle.<br />
"Yes," replied Júlia grabbing the Coca-cola bottle and drinking from the beak.<br />
Then they got ready for New Year's Eve, it was eleven and fifty o'clock at night.<br />
Júlia left the bottle of Coca-cola in the kitchen to put it in recycling the day after.<br />
Littletato turned the TV off, the movie they watched was registered on the Watch History of Littletato's Vegeflix account.<br />
The couple locked the house and started walking downtown to see the New Year's clock.<br />
Both of them looked at the beautiful scenery, the trees, and the lights of the city of San Francisco.<br />
There were a lot of people walking towards downtown to see the New Year Countdown.<br />
<br />
After some minutes of walking, the couple arrived downtown.<br />
A big crowd was there, the people were looking high at the big screen that was installed on a famous building in the city.<br />
There were still eight minutes left to the New Year, the people watched the minutes pass on the digital display.<br />
A lot of couples hugged tight and kissed, a lot of families hugged themselves.<br />
It was a moment of happiness for everyone, everyone was in the spirit of Reveillon, making wishes for the New Year.<br />
There were still five minutes left to the New Year, the people were looking at the big and high screen on the building.<br />
Littletato thought about what she did this year after she met Júlia and her life changed.<br />
She thought about the friends that she made during this year after she moved to San Francisco and before.<br />
About her first interview in San Francisco, she was happy thinking that she got a job at the Interworks Technologies company.<br />
The girl thought about when she first met Júlia at that coffee shop when she declared her love for Júlia (chapter 1).<br />
When she met her coworker, Littletato thought that she was kind and gentle (chapter 2).<br />
That day that she bought the house, she was so happy that day, owning a house along with Júlia (chapter 1).<br />
Her various days going to work walking while listening to her folk playlist on the Vegetify app on her smartphone.<br />
When Littletato met Júlia's sister, Vitória, she was a designer, and a very interesting person (chapter 4).<br />
That day when Littletato taught Júlia to draw in the Paint Tool SAI program on her computer (chapter 5).<br />
The dream she had about being a space traveler along with Júlia (chapter 5).<br />
When Littletato went to that park on Saturday and Iam appeared there, Littletato presented him to Júlia, and then they went to the supermarket and bought a bottle of Coca-cola (chapter 6).<br />
The Sunday when they played a lot of games in the Vegebox videogame that Littletato had, they played Vegetablefall 2 (chapter 7).<br />
That Monday when she watched Captain Vegerica: Vegetable War with Júlia while eating Doritos and drinking Coca-cola, it was very cool (chapter 8).<br />
Her farm and rain dream, drinking a can of Coca-cola outside the old house, it started raining and she entered the house, wore some light clothes, and slept (chapter 9).<br />
The allegoric dream with the Mexican man singing, the boy playing his electric guitar like a Dubstep bass, the gray-haired girl with the fridge, and the boy writing a story on his computer about a grape (chapter 10).<br />
That dream she had about going on a trip to Texas with Júlia, she woke up and did a lot of things, she watched an episode of Atypical with Júlia (chapter 11).<br />
When Littletato had a cookie factory and a cyberpunk dream, a dream about a cookie factory, and when she dreamt of that Castle of Glass and Twilight Sparkle (chapter 12).<br />
That day when she watched The Vegengers: Infinite Vegetablewar with Júlia, she posted the movie on her Vegesapp status (chapter 13).<br />
Thirty seconds were remaining for the New Year, the crowd counted together.<br />
Everyone shouting together, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.<br />
There were fireworks on the big screen and real fireworks too, everyone shouted "Happy New Year! Happy 2019!"<br />
Everyone was happy and smiling, looking at their relatives, their partners.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 01/01/2019.<br />
Finished revising it on 14/01/2021.<br />
<br />
It was really good to revise it while listening to the Yuru Camp anime soundtrack and an Indie Folk music mix.<br />
This chapter has a lot of references to previous reviewed chapters of The Life of Littletato.<br />
I loved revising this chapter, it was really good.<br />
I'm so happy about this chapter, what a way to end the year of 2018 &colon;3 😊.<br />
A lot of good memories about the older chapters of Littletato.<br />
Thank you so much for reading! And thank you for reading Littletato for all the year of 2018.<br />
And also for reading the story during 2020.<br />
I hope to revise even more chapters in 2021, the chapters made in 2019.<br />

		It was Monday, it was a little cold, Littletato woke up, she got to work today.<br />
Littletato thought about last night, it was Sunday, day 31 of December 2018, she was happy, watching that superhero movie with Júlia while eating Doritos and drinking Coca-cola.<br />
And also thinking of what she did in 2018, the friends she made, Mia, Iam, Vitória, and others.<br />
Littletato had these thoughts on her mind while she was in bed, looking at the ceiling, it was five and forty AM.<br />
The sun was beginning to shine through the curtains, Littletato stretched, hugging Júlia and kissing her lips.<br />
After that, Littletato got up, did her morning needs, and walked to the kitchen.<br />
Littletato grabbed two plates and placed them on top of the kitchen table, she grabbed the bread sack and opened it.<br />
Placing two slices on each plate, then she closed the bread sack and stored it inside the kitchen cabinet.<br />
After that, the girl walked to the fridge and opened it, she thought about that TPF fridge ad that she saw one day on TV.<br />
She grabbed the cheese and milk, after that, she walked to the kitchen table and placed both the milk and cheese on top of it.<br />
Then she walked to the kitchen sink and grabbed a knife and two cups made of glass.<br />
Littletato placed both the cups on top of the table, then she grabbed a spoon and placed it inside one of the cups.<br />
She cut two slices of cheese for each bread, then she placed two slices on each bread and closed them.<br />
The girl grabbed the spoon and left it on top of the table, she filled the two cups with milk.<br />
After that, Littletato grabbed the chocolate powder packet from the cabinet and put some chocolate powder on each cup.<br />
She mixed the chocolate powder on the two cups with the help of the spoon.<br />
Then Littletato walked to the bedroom, she woke up Júlia with a kiss on her lips.<br />
Júlia got up and did her morning necessities, then the couple walked to the kitchen and sat at the table to eat breakfast.<br />
<br />
They both eat breakfast, Júlia said that it was delicious, Littletato said thanks while smiling.<br />
Littletato thought about the rain, how it felt, the sound that it made, she liked the rain, she liked to hear the raindrops hit the roof of her house, she liked thunder too.<br />
The girl got up, she placed the plates and the cups on top of the sink, after that, she walked to the bedroom.<br />
She started preparing herself to go to work, Júlia was there with her.<br />
"Hey, honey, what do you think about living with Iam, Mia, Carol, and Vitória?" asked Júlia, curious.<br />
"What do you mean honey?" asked Littletato, sitting on the bed, putting on her socks and shoes.<br />
"Hmm... It is a dream of mine, to have a big house, and to live with all our friends, and my sister, what do you think of that, hon?" asked Júlia, who was sitting at the side of Littletato.<br />
"I think it is a good dream hon, I wanted to live with my sister too, maybe when we have a lot of money and I have a higher rank at my work," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that's good honey, hehe, I think I'm gonna start working too then, and storing my money on the bank," said Júlia, kissing Littletato's cheek while smiling.<br />
"Okay, hehe," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
Then Littletato got up, she walked to the front door of the house, opening it.<br />
Júlia hugged her and kissed her lips, "I'm gonna bring the key to the house okay hon? In case you want to go out for something," asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay, hon, don't worry, I have the spare key," replied Júlia.<br />
Then Littletato got out of the house and started walking to work.<br />
<br />
Júlia locked the front door of the house and walked to the kitchen.<br />
The kitchen of Littletato's house was on the right of the living room, there was a little room where they had their computers.<br />
After looking through the window to see the weather, Júlia opened the fridge, she grabbed her bottle of water and drank a little of it.<br />
Then Júlia placed the bottle inside the fridge and closed it.<br />
Júlia walked to the bedroom, her smartphone was charging on the socket that existed on the wall, her smartphone was on the floor.<br />
She threw herself on the bed and looked at the ceiling, she sighed and thought about how she was feeling right now.<br />
Júlia always spends her day inside the house while Littletato works.<br />
The girl has some money in her bank account, she can help Littletato with the bills if she needs it.<br />
But the salary of Littletato is enough so she can pay the bills, buy food, and store the rest in her bank account.<br />
So Júlia can spend her day laid on the bed, doing nothing all day, but today she is not feeling like doing anything.<br />
Júlia yawned and turned to the left side of the bed, looking at the open window, she could see the yard of the house, there were some trees there.<br />
The girl stretched herself and got out of bed, walking to the computer room, the room where the computer of Littletato and the laptop of Júlia stayed.<br />
After that, she sat on the chair of Littletato's computer, she could use her computer, Júlia had a computer account just for her.<br />
Júlia turned the computer on, it was very fast to boot, she logged in using her account.<br />
The girl looked at the hours on the right bottom corner of the screen, it was 7:30 AM, Littletato was probably working by now.<br />
<br />
Júlia wanted to find a job in San Francisco, she heard that there were a lot of jobs there.<br />
The girl opened the Mozilla Vegefox web browser and opened some job websites.<br />
She found a lot of jobs, the girl created an account on that website, she started signing up for a lot of jobs.<br />
Júlia inserted her phone number on the website.<br />
If she was applied for a job interview, they would send her a message on Vegesapp.<br />
Júlia signed up for a total of fifty jobs, she was very happy and excited.<br />
Then she closed the tabs and closed Mozilla Vegefox too, she opened a game to play.<br />
The game was called "Project Zomboid", it was a zombie and survival game, Júlia liked it a lot, the feeling of loneliness that it caused her.<br />
She liked those types of games, the ones that make you feel immersed inside the universe of the game, and that cause you an emotion.<br />
Júlia clicked on the continue button to load her latest save game, she was controlling a character called Anna Thompson, who had fifteen-seven years old.<br />
The girl was inside her house, she killed a lot of zombies around the outside of her house with her fireman ax.<br />
So she did not need to worry about zombies knocking on her door.<br />
Her house was all barricaded with planks on the windows, no zombie could see her from outside.<br />
She had plant seeds, a compost crate, a rain collector barrel with a garbage bag inside it.<br />
The girl was training her carpentry skills, she dismantled chairs and tables to gain more experience.<br />
Júlia loved to play that game, it felt like she was living on the zombie apocalypse.<br />
<br />
After playing for some hours, Júlia was a little tired, she stretched back on the chair.<br />
The girl paused the game and clicked on the "Leave" button to go back to the main menu.<br />
Júlia looked at the hours, it was eight AM, she was a little hungry, she closed the game and turned the computer off.<br />
She got up and walked to the kitchen, opening the fridge, after that, she picked up the milk, the cheese, and a meat hamburger made of artificial meat that Littletato bought.<br />
Then Júlia grabbed a frying pan and placed it on one of the stove-tops, she walked to the cabinet and grabbed the sack of bread.<br />
Júlia grabbed two slices of bread, grabbed a plate, and placed it on top of the table.<br />
She turned the stove on and waited for a while, then she placed the two slices of bread on the frying pan.<br />
They began to toast on top of the stovetop, she waited for a while, looking below the slices of bread to check if it was burning.<br />
After some minutes, it was ready, Júlia turned the stove off and placed the slices on the plate, she grabbed the cheese and artificial meat.<br />
Júlia then placed one slice of cheese on the bread, she placed the artificial meat on the frying pan, turning the stove on.<br />
After some minutes, the artificial meat began to get warmer, she removed it from the frying pan and placed it on top of the bread.<br />
The cheese began to melt, she closed the bread and grabbed it, placing it on top of the frying pan and closing it with an aluminum lid.<br />
Júlia waited for a while, then she removed the lid and turned the stove off, putting the bread on the plate.<br />
She made a cup of chocolate milk for her, then she walked to the living room and turned the TV on, opening the Vegeflix app and selecting her favorite cartoon, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.<br />
Júlia watched some episodes of MLP: FIM while eating and drinking, it was very delicious, she watched more episodes after eating, then she slept on the couch, the cartoon was still playing.<br />
<br />
After some hours, Littletato got home, she opened the front door and closed it, she turned the TV off and woke up Júlia with a kiss and a hug.<br />
They prepared dinner together and ate, then they walked to the living room and sat there.<br />
Littletato remembered that she watched Vegetower Rangers when she was little, with the Megazords, laser guns, and robots.<br />
She heard that a new reboot movie of that show launched some days ago, Littletato wanted to watch it.<br />
The girl told that to Júlia, she said that she also watched Vegetower Rangers when she was a kid, she said that a friend showed her the show.<br />
Júlia suggested for them to watch the new movie.<br />
Littletato was sat at the right of the couch, the side where the front door was.<br />
Júlia was sat on the left side of the couch, she left her smartphone on top of the low table that existed on the left of the couch.<br />
After that, Littletato grabbed the TV controller that was on top of the table that existed in the center of the living room.<br />
The girl turned the TV on and opened the Vegeflix app, she started searching for the reboot movie of Vegetower Rangers on Vegeflix's catalog.<br />
Suddenly, Júlia's smartphone ringed, she grabbed it to see what it was.<br />
It was Vitória, Júlia's sister, she sent a message to Júlia through Vegesapp, asking if she could go to Littletato's house next Sunday to make a barbecue.<br />
"Hey honey, it is Vitória, she is asking if she can go here on Sunday to make a barbecue with us," asked Júlia, looking at Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that sounds great hon, tell her that she can come," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay," said Júlia, who replied to Vitória's message, "Yes, you can come, sis, do you want us to buy the artificial meat and the artificial sausages?"<br />
"Yes, please, I'll help you guys pay for the food, can you also buy garlic bread too? Please ^^, It's gonna be delicious, hehe," replied Vitória.<br />
"Yes, hehe, we're gonna buy everything, don't worry, and thanks, sis," said Júlia who then sent a happy emoji.<br />
"Okay sis, thanks. ^^," replied Vitória.<br />
Littletato found the movie on Vegeflix, she pressed play and got up to turn the living room light off.<br />
Júlia blocked the screen of her smartphone and placed it on top of the table on the left of the couch.<br />
The couple started watching the movie, it started showing a teenager.<br />
The movie told the story of five teenagers that got superpowers when they got close to a meteor that landed in the city they lived in.<br />
Both of them watched the movie while hugging and caressing each other's hairs, they were happy watching together.<br />
After that, Júlia and Littletato turned off the TV and the house lights, they walked to the bedroom and laid on the bed, hugging tight and sleeping happily together.<br />
<br />

		It was a Tuesday, Littletato was dreaming about traveling the world by bicycle, she had money and supplies in bags that were tied to her bicycle.<br />
That was a very good way to live life, traveling and stuff, seeing a lot of new places and new faces.<br />
Littletato did that before she stopped at San Francisco, but she uses buses, taxis, and airplanes, now she is on her own.<br />
She was ready to see the world for what it is, Littletato continued riding her bicycle, wanting to arrive in the next city, Concord, CA.<br />
The girl arrived there and stopped by a gas station to fill the tire of her bicycle, she filled it and opened one of her bags, grabbing a bottle of water.<br />
Littletato drank some sips of the bottle of water and stored it in the bag again, she grabbed her smartphone and opened the map app to look for something interesting to see in Concord.<br />
She found some good places, then she stored her smartphone on one of the bags, getting on top of her bicycle.<br />
Littletato started riding to Haute Coffee, a local coffee shop that had a lot of good reviews.<br />
The girl was a little hungry because of the trip, she rode some more and arrived there, parking her bicycle on a road sign and locking it with her bicycle lock.<br />
She got off the bicycle with her wallet, entering the coffee shop, ordered a decaf latte of $4.20 for her, and started walking to a table.<br />
Then she sat at the table, grabbing her smartphone, she waited a while for her coffee while looking at other things to do in Concord.<br />
A waitress arrived with her order, placing it on top of the table, she asked if Littletato wanted something more.<br />
Littletato ordered an Egg Sandwich for $3.95, and also a Mocha for $4.75, the waitress annotated that in her notebook and walked back to behind the counter.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato opened the Vegetify app on her smartphone, she had mobile data, she put to play the soundtrack of the Yuru Camp anime.<br />
She was looking at her right, there were two windows there, outside was a big tree with its leaves swaying in the wind.<br />
The girl put one of her earphones on her right ear, she started listening to the calm songs of the soundtrack while looking at the tree and enjoying the moment.<br />
Littletato continued to listen to the soundtrack while drinking her decaf latte sometimes.<br />
After waiting for some minutes, the waitress arrived with her order, she placed the Mocha and the plate with the Egg Sandwich on top of the table.<br />
"Call me if you want something else okay?" asked the waitress.<br />
"Okay, thanks," replied Littletato with a smile.<br />
She took a picture of the sandwich, decaf latte, and Mocha with her smartphone.<br />
Then Littletato started to eat her egg sandwich while drinking her decaf latte, it was very delicious. it had melted Cabot cheddar on lightly dressed arugula.<br />
Littletato thought that the coffee was very delicious too, she drank and ate it while listening to the Yuru Camp anime soundtrack.<br />
When she finished eating the sandwich and drinking the decaf latte, she started drinking the Mocha while talking to her friends on Vegesapp and Vegebook.<br />
Littletato posted the picture she took of the three items on her Vegesapp status, Carol asked her for the location where she was in.<br />
She sent a message to Carol saying that it was in Concord, CA, Carol replied saying that she wanted to go to Concord because a relative of hers lived there.<br />
Then Littletato sent the location of the Haute Coffee to Carol, Carol replied saying thanks with a face smiling emoji.<br />
After that, Littletato paused the music and stored her earphones in her bag, she stored her smartphone there too.<br />
Littletato walked to the counter to pay for the food, she paid and walked out of the coffee shop.<br />
<br />
The girl wanted to see Louisa May Alcott's Orchard House, it was one of the things that she marked to do in Concord, she heard that it had a lot of history in it.<br />
She grabbed her bicycle and started riding there while looking at the map, she had something to lock her smartphone on her bicycle.<br />
After riding for a while, she arrived there, she parked her bicycle on a street sign on the sidewalk and locked it with her bicycle lock.<br />
The girl looked at the place and read some signs, learning about the house, and the history of the place, there was a Museum Store in there.<br />
Louisa May Alcott wrote the novel called Little Women.<br />
Alcott family's contributed a lot to the fields of literature, education, philosophy, the arts, and social justice through award-winning guided tours, unique educational programs for students of all ages, and lively living history events.<br />
Littletato was amazed to learn about all that, seeing the local culture and history is fun.<br />
Júlia was dreaming about traveling the world by van with her family and friends.<br />
She was having fun there, eating stuff and talking, seeing her cousins that she has not seen in a long time.<br />
Júlia was smiling, looking at her friends, cousins, and family, her dad was driving, her mother was sitting beside him.<br />
His sister Vitória and her brother Rogério were sitting on the first row of the van.<br />
<br />
Then both of them woke up, Júlia and Littletato looked at each other, they smiled and hugged, kissing each other's lips.<br />
Littletato got up and did her morning necessities, Júlia did the same.<br />
They walked to the kitchen and started making breakfast.<br />
After some minutes, they finished and started eating.<br />
"Hey, honey, I started searching for jobs yesterday, I signed up for a total of fifty jobs," said Júlia while holding her cup of chocolate milk.<br />
"Oh, that's great honey, are you planning to buy something or just store the money in your bank account?" asked Littletato, curious, fiddling with the bread.<br />
"I'm thinking of buying a computer, and also a desk to put it on.<br />
I want to put the desk on the opposite side of your desk, so we can play games together," said Júlia, looking at the room to the right of her, imagining the desk and her computer there.<br />
"I think that's good honey, I was really happy when I bought my computer some months after I bought the house.<br />
Maybe we can play some games together honey, like Rocket League, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare, Overcooked, Osu!" said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, those games seem fun, I watched Alanzoka play Overcooked one day, it was good and fun to play with friends, it's funny I think," replied Júlia.<br />
"I agree, honey, I want to play it with you!" said Littletato smiling.<br />
"Me too, honey, I think I'll buy an external hard drive of 1TB to move all the files from my laptop to it, then I'm gonna sell my laptop," said Júlia.<br />
"Oh, okay hon, you'll create a VegeSteam account after you buy your computer?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes," replied Júlia, "I'm gonna gift you some games then hon," said Littletato.<br />
"Thanks, hon," replied Júlia.<br />
After that, the couple finished eating.<br />
Littletato prepared herself to go to work, she was ready and walked to the front door, Júlia hugged her and kissed her lips, saying goodbye.<br />
Then Littletato started walking to her job.<br />
After some minutes of walking, she arrived there and entered the building.<br />
<br />
Júlia locked the front door and walked to the kitchen, grabbing her bottle of water from the fridge and taking some sips of it, then she stored the bottle on the fridge again.<br />
She walked to the small room to the right of the kitchen, turning on Littletato's computer, when it turned on, she sat at the chair and logged in her account on the computer.<br />
The girl opened Mozilla Vegefox and opened some job websites, she continued signing up for jobs, the girl wanted to find one no matter what it was, as long as it paid well.<br />
Júlia applied for fifty jobs, she was happy about that, she closed the web browser tab and opened another, she opened the website called Vegewitch.<br />
She opened the Livestream of the Alanzoka streamer, he was streaming a game called Tarkov, it was a first-person shooter with a lot of realistic features.<br />
The girl liked to watch that streamer, she put the Livestream to play on the speakers and turned on the fullscreen mode of the website.<br />
Júlia turned up the volume of the Livestream and got off the chair, she walked to the kitchen and grabbed the bread sack from the cabinet.<br />
She placed two slices of bread on a plate and cut some cheese slices for her, making a sandwich, then she made a cup of chocolate milk for her.<br />
After that, she walked back to the computer room, sitting on the chair and eating and drinking while watching the Livestream.<br />
Júlia ate and drank for some minutes while watching, then she finished eating, she grabbed the plate and the cup, placing them on the sink.<br />
She had left her phone on top of the computer desk, it was charging, her laptop was on top of the table in the bedroom.<br />
Her phone vibrated, it was in silent mode, she received a message on Vegesapp.<br />
The girl grabbed the smartphone, it was a message from a business account called "Safeway", it was a supermarket company.<br />
Júlia read the message, it said that she was applied for a job interview at 6 PM tomorrow, and asked if she was up for the interview.<br />
She replied saying yes, they replied that it was annotated on their agenda.<br />
<br />
The girl was so happy, she was smiling and believing that she was going to get the job.<br />
Júlia could not wait for tomorrow at 6 PM, she continued watching the Livestream of Alanzoka.<br />
She turned her smartphone off so it would charge quickly, then she left the smartphone on top of the table.<br />
The girl remembered that Littletato had a game called Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare on her computer, its shortcut was on the desktop.<br />
Júlia closed the Livestream and Mozilla Vegefox too, she opened the game to play and waited for it to load.<br />
It loaded, she selected the Warzone mode, which was the Battle Royale version of CoD: MW, Júlia liked to train and practice on that mode.<br />
She perceived that she was getting better every day, she wanted to have her computer so she could play it all the time.<br />
Júlia started the match, the Battle Royale game mode consists of one hundred players on a map.<br />
They have to survive and be the last ones alive, only one player can be the winner on solo mode.<br />
On four people, three people, or two people mode, the team of people has to be the last one alive.<br />
The players land on the map and have to find weapons on the buildings of the map, they only arrive there with a pistol.<br />
There are shields for them to protect themselves, they can have three shields, when they get shot, their shields get broken and they have to replace them.<br />
If players are killed, they go to the Gulag where they need to kill another player to win the chance of going back to the game.<br />
Then, if they die in Gulag, they can not play in that match anymore if they are on solo mode.<br />
If they are in team mode, their team can buy them back with money.<br />
Júlia was in solo mode, she liked to play alone and feel like she could go anywhere, but she also could not count on anyone.<br />
She landed at the Gorengard Lumber Yard and started picking up weapons and shields from the ground.<br />
The girl found an M4A1 and three shields, she used the three shields to protect herself.<br />
After playing for a while, the match ended, Júlia finished in #4, she had made many kills.<br />
Júlia continued playing for a while, drinking water sometimes, and eating when she was hungry, stopping to take a break and do some exercise.<br />
It was a little late at night, Littletato had arrived, Júlia turned the computer off and greet Littletato.<br />
The couple made dinner and ate, Júlia said that she got a job interview and she is going there tomorrow at 6 PM.<br />
Littletato was happy because of that, she smiled while looking at Júlia.<br />
Both of them finished eating, they waited for some minutes before laying on the bed.<br />
Then, they laid on the bed and slept, hugging tight in the cold night, Júlia slept while thinking of her gaming session with CoD: MW.<br />
<br />
(It was very good revising this chapter.<br />
I wrote it on 29/01/2019.<br />
And I finished revising it on 29/01/2021.<br />
What a coincidence O_O, Wow.<br />
<br />
I loved to revise this chapter while listening to the Yuru Camp soundtrack a lot, I love that anime and that soundtrack.<br />
It was very good, I loved to think about Júlia and the job interview.<br />
The conversation between Littletato and Júlia about computers and games was so much fun!<br />
I loved searching for good places to spend time in Concord, CA, Haute Coffee and Louisa May Alcott's Orchard House are real places in Concord.<br />
Littletato buying coffee and eating a sandwich on Haute Coffee remembered me of the second episode of the second season of Yuru Camp at 05:00 where Rin buys some tea and a green cake at a coffee shop on the upper floor of where she bought some teas.<br />
I think Littletato and Rin are a little bit alike, and the Littletato website too, I think brown passes that sensation of a calm and homey feel.<br />
Of a place where you can spend time and relax, a warm house of wood in the winter, that's how I feel about this website, Yuru Camp, and The Life of Littletato.<br />
I feel like this is a quiet, calm, and warm place to spend some time and relax, relaxing while reading a story about a potato. xD<br />

		It was a Wednesday, Júlia woke up first, she was dreaming about the rain, hearing the sounds of the raindrops and the thunders.<br />
She got out of bed, she had to go to her job interview at the Safeway supermarket franchise that existed in San Francisco.<br />
The girl walked to the bathroom and made her morning necessities, she washed her face, brushed her teeth, and brushed her hair.<br />
After that, she walked to the kitchen, she started making breakfast for her and Littletato.<br />
Júlia made two sandwiches, one for her and one for Littletato, both with artificial meat hamburgers and a slice of cheese.<br />
Then she prepared two cups of chocolate milk, she walked to the bedroom and laid beside Littletato.<br />
She hugged Littletato and kissed her lips, it was five and fifty AM, she told Littletato to woke up.<br />
Littletato got off the bed and did her morning necessities, she then walked to the kitchen, she was surprised by the food, it looked delicious.<br />
"Thanks, hon," said Littletato, smiling while hugging Júlia.<br />
"No problem, hehe, I love to make you happy and make good for you honey," replied Júlia.<br />
Then they sat at the table and started to eat together.<br />
"Hey honey, I'm gonna go to a job interview today at six PM okay?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Okay hon, what is the company?" asked Littletato.<br />
"It's a Safeway franchise that exists in San Francisco," replied Júlia.<br />
"Oh, that's a good place to work," said Littletato.<br />
Then they finished eating, Littletato grabbed the cups and the plates, placing them on top of the sink.<br />
She started preparing herself to go to work, changing herself, and putting on her shoes, it was almost six AM.<br />
Júlia washed the plates and cups, leaving them on the dish dryer.<br />
Then Littletato walked to the front door of the house, she gave a big hug to Júlia and walked out, closing the door.<br />
Júlia walked to the couch and sat there, she turned on the TV and started watching it.<br />
Some minutes passed, she was tired of the TV, it was seven and forty AM.<br />
The girl turned off the TV, got off the couch, and walked to the computer room, turning Littletato's computer on.<br />
She started signing up for jobs on job websites, she thought that it was not certain that she was going to get the job at the Safeway company.<br />
<br />
Some hours passed, Littletato worked a lot, she fixed and app and did the front-end part of another app, the design of it.<br />
Júlia spent her hours on the computer, signing up for jobs, watching Livestreams, eating, and playing games.<br />
It was five and forty PM, Littletato arrived home, she locked the door, Júlia was on Littletato's computer.<br />
"I'm home honey, Tadaima, hehe," said Littletato, leaving her bag on the couch.<br />
"Okaeri honey," said Júlia, smiling, she looked at Littletato.<br />
Júlia then turned off the computer, walked to the living room, and hugged Littletato tight, kissing her lips.<br />
Then they made the afternoon coffee, they ate together, it was delicious.<br />
After that, Júlia started preparing herself to go to the job interview, she grabbed her smartphone and asked for the location of the company on the Vegesapp app.<br />
The Safeway company sent her the location, then she blocked the screen of her smartphone.<br />
She placed the clothes she was going to use on top of the bed, then she took a bath and prepared herself.<br />
Júlia walked to the front door, she had her bag with her smartphone, the spare key of the house, and some money for a bus.<br />
"Good luck honey, I hope you get the job," said Littletato, hugging her and smiling, kissing her cheek.<br />
"Thanks, hon," replied Júlia, smiling, then she got out of the house and started walking to the bus stop.<br />
She got a bus that passed close to the location where she was going to make the job interview, it was a bus from the Muni company, she paid $2.50 for it.<br />
Júlia entered the bus and paid for it, she sat there, the bus started driving.<br />
After some minutes, she arrived at the location, she asked the bus to stop, it stopped and she got out.<br />
Then she saw the place where the company was and started walking towards it, then she entered inside it.<br />
Júlia talked to the woman who was part of the customer attendance service staff, she said that she was coming there for an interview.<br />
The woman accompanied her to a room and she sat there, there was a supermarket clerk there.<br />
He started asking questions and she started replying to them, questions about past experiences, about Profit and Loss, and other supermarket things.<br />
After some minutes, the interview ended, Júlia thought that she did well, the interviewer thanked her, after that, she left the building.<br />
Then she started walking to the bus stop, she caught a bus to go back home, the bus arrived, she entered it and paid $2.50 for it.<br />
After waiting for some minutes, Júlia arrived home, she unlocked the front door with the spare key and entered the house.<br />
"Hey honey, welcome back!" said Littletato, smiling, she was sat at the house.<br />
"Thanks, hon," said Júlia, "Did you get it?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I don't know, they're gonna analyze and give me the response tomorrow, but the clerk was very happy," replied Júlia, sitting beside Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that's good honey, I hope you get it," said Littletato, hugging Júlia.<br />
<br />
It was seven and thirty PM, Júlia was a little hungry, "Let's eat something hon?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yeah, let's eat, and wait for a while, so we can go to sleep early," replied Littletato.<br />
"Okay hon," said Júlia, who started walking to the kitchen.<br />
The couple made two sandwiches, there was a bottle of Coca-cola on the fridge, Littletato grabbed and filled two cups with it.<br />
Then they ate, it was delicious, Littletato loved the things in the sandwich.<br />
After that, the couple walked to the computer room, Littletato sat at the chair of her computer, turning it on.<br />
Júlia walked to the bedroom and wore some more comfortable clothes, then she grabbed her laptop and walked back to the computer room.<br />
The girl placed her laptop on top of the desk, on the right side of Littletato's computer.<br />
She turned the laptop on and opened Mozilla Vegefox, she opened VegeTube.<br />
"Hey, honey, wanna read a story with me on Veggepad?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, honey, what is Veggepad?" asked Júlia.<br />
"It is a story website, you can read and write stories in it," replied Littletato.<br />
"Okay hon," said Júlia, then Littletato opened Mozilla Vegefox and opened the Veggepad website.<br />
She began to scroll on the feed, looking for a specific author, stane2, she found it and clicked on his profile.<br />
"What are we gonna read hon?" asked Júlia, looking at the screen.<br />
"It's a story by the author called stane2, he writes a lot of good stories, I think he updated the story called 'The Life of Bigbeet'," replied Littletato.<br />
"That story sounds like fun, the story of a beetroot," said Júlia while giggling a little.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Littletato while smiled, who clicked on the story.<br />
<br />
They started to read, the chapter had two thousand words, it was a little long.<br />
It talked about the life of a beetroot who wanted to be a traveler, she wished to become an astronaut someday.<br />
The name of the beetroot was Sasha, she was a redhead, the girl had eighteen years old, she lived in the city of Maringá, in the state of Paraná that exists in the country of Brazil.<br />
She worked in a book store, she was happy about her job because she could borrow books from it to read, she loved to read.<br />
Sasha also liked to talk to her Brazilian friends, she was very good at school and had some friends there.<br />
The girl liked to play games on her Vbox One, she played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Overcooked, and No Man's Sky.<br />
Her mother worked a lot to support the family, she was successful in her work, she worked in a technology company.<br />
Sasha's father was a trucker, he took long trips to deliver products, gas, and water, she could not see him too often.<br />
The girl had a friend called Yuri, he also studied in the school that Sasha attended, he also had a Vbox One, she played games with him.<br />
Sasha always dreamt of traveling far away, visiting a lot of places, eating different food, eating all kinds of food but insects, snakes, cats, and dogs, Sasha did not want to eat those.<br />
One day, she was sat on her computer's chair, it was six and thirty PM, she was a little tired from a match of COD: MW, she reclined in the chair and stretched herself.<br />
She closed the game and got up, walking to the kitchen, her mother was home already.<br />
"Mom, do we still have some Coca-cola cans?" asked Sasha to her mother who was in her room.<br />
"Yes, I think we have three, check the refrigerator," replied Sasha's mother from her room, she was called Claudia and had blond hair.<br />
Then Sasha opened the refrigerator and grabbed a can of Coca-cola, then she walked to the kitchen cabinet, she opened it and grabbed a packet of Doritos.<br />
She started walking to her bedroom.<br />
"Hey, mom, I'm gonna watch a movie okay?" asked her from the upper hall of the house, the hall that led to the room of Sasha's parents and the bathroom.<br />
"Okay sweetie," replied Claudia, who was laid on her bed, resting.<br />
"At twenty at night, I'm gonna start making dinner, will you help me sweetie?" asked Claudia.<br />
"Yes mom, I will," replied Sasha, "Thanks," said Claudia.<br />
"No problem, hehe," said Sasha, who continued walking to her bedroom, she left the Doritos packet on top of the table along with the can of Coca-cola.<br />
<br />
Littletato saved the link of the chapter on her website, she was a little tired, she stretched herself, Júlia did that too.<br />
They were a little tired of reading, Júlia kissed Littletato's cheek, "Hey honey, I'm going to sleep are you coming with me?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yes, hehe, I'm just gonna read a chapter of The Story of the Bulkan Siblings okay honey?" asked Littletato, who gave a quick kiss on Júlia's lips.<br />
"Alright honey," said Júlia, who kissed Littletato's lips back, then she turned her laptop off and left it charging.<br />
She walked to the bedroom and laid on the bed, covering herself with the blanket and closing her eyes, trying to sleep.<br />
Littletato opened another story of the author called stane2, it was called The Story of the Bulkan Siblings, she started to read one chapter of it.<br />
It was very interesting, Littletato liked to see the adventures of the brothers Izaque and Lulu, she finished reading the chapter and turned off her computer.<br />
Then the girl walked to the bedroom and laid on the bed alongside Júlia, she covered herself with the blanket and hugged Júlia tight, cuddling with her.<br />
<br />
(I loved revising this chapter, I started revising it on 02/02/2021.<br />
And finished revising it on 04/02/2021.<br />
<br />
It was very good to revise, I wrote that Sasha is beetroot and is a redhead because I thought of Sasha from the Shingeki No Kyojin anime, the potato girl.<br />
I loved to write about Júlia's interview, and about Sasha's story, which is "The Life of Bigbeet", the big beet, the opposite of Littletato, which is little, and a potato...<br />
Tell me the name of a fruit or vegetable that is the opposite of potatoes, please.<br />
I want to continue writing more Littletato and also write the "spin-off" version of Littletato, which is The Life of Bigbeet.<br />
I think a spin-off is something that is not shown in the original story and is shown in a side story.<br />
Anyway, thank you for reading chapter 17 of The Life of Littletato, send me a message on my social media saying what you thought about the chapter, please.<br />
Thanks, bye. :3)

		It was a Thursday, Littletato was awake, she got up and prepared herself for her job.<br />
She made breakfast and woke up Júlia, then she ate with her.<br />
Littletato walked to the front door and hugged Júlia, kissing her lips, she got out of the house and started walking to her job, it was six AM.<br />
Júlia stretched and walked to the living room, she laid on the couch, "Hm... I slept really well last night," thought Júlia.<br />
Then she got up and walked to the computer room, she turned Littletato's computer on.<br />
After that, Júlia walked to the bedroom, grabbing her smartphone that was in the wall socket, it was fully charged, she removed the charger from the socket.<br />
Júlia then walked to the computer room, she sat at the chair of Littletato's computer and began fiddling with her smartphone while waiting for the computer to boot up.<br />
The computer turned on, she looked at the Windows home screen, the girl opened a game called Osu! to play, it was a music and rhythm game.<br />
She looked at her smartphone screen, opened the Vegesapp app, and looked at her messages.<br />
There was a message from the Safeway company, saying that she was applied for the job.<br />
Júlia was so happy, she smiled while looking at it, then she clicked on it and replied saying thank you.<br />
Littletato could use her smartphone at work, as long as it was not used for too much time.<br />
Júlia sent a message to Littletato saying that she got the job, Littletato was so happy about that, she sent a smiling face emoji to Júlia along with "Congratulations Honey!"<br />
Then Júlia smiled from ear to ear, "I begin working tomorrow, from twelve PM to six PM," said her in a message to Littletato.<br />
"That's good honey! That means you'll be out half of the day right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, hehe, I think it will be great," replied Júlia.<br />
"I'm happy for you hon, I have to work right now, see you later sweetie!" said Littletato.<br />
"Okay, see you later hon ^^," replied Júlia.<br />
Then Júlia looked at the computer screen, the "Osu!" game was open, playing the music theme of the game.<br />
She locked the screen of her smartphone, then she left it on top of the table and started playing Osu! for some hours.<br />
The girl had to click on circles and hold the mouse button on sliders to the beat of the song, she liked to play that game.<br />
<br />
After some time playing, Júlia was a little tired, she stretched and yawned, then she turned off the computer.<br />
It was eight AM, she got up and walked to the kitchen, grabbing her bottle of water and drinking a little of it.<br />
She wanted to get out to go for a walk, her legs were a little tired from sitting down for too much time.<br />
The girl grabbed a dark-grey empty backpack and placed her bottle of water inside the backpack.<br />
Júlia could go on her bicycle but she wanted to go on foot, she walked to the bedroom and wore her socks and blue sneakers.<br />
She walked to the front door and opened it, then she walked out of the house, locking the front door and storing the key in her pocket.<br />
The girl started walking to a park that she knew where was, some people looked at her, saying good morning, she said good morning back.<br />
Júlia looked at the trees, the leaves, and nature, it was very beautiful, it was a little chill, the sun was not too hot.<br />
It was very good weather to go for a walk, she continued walking for some minutes.<br />
Iam was walking too, he was walking in the opposite direction that Júlia was walking.<br />
They both stopped and looked at each other, "Hey Júlia," said Iam.<br />
"Hey, Iam, nice to see you," said Júlia while smiling.<br />
"I was going for a walk, my job starts at twelve PM, it is very good to walk while is chill right?" asked Iam, hugging himself.<br />
"Yeah, I agree, hehe," said Júlia.<br />
"So, how's Littletato?" asked Iam.<br />
"She's good, working very hard, my sister said that she's gonna come to our house Sunday to make a barbecue with us," said Júlia, smiling.<br />
Iam smiled back at Júlia, "Oh, that's good, can I come too?" asked Iam, thinking about artificial sausages and artificial meat.<br />
"Yes, of course! Hehe," replied Júlia, "Okay, hehe," said Iam.<br />
"Is your sister in town?" asked Júlia.<br />
"No, she is on the house of my parents, in New York, she only comes on Mondays or the weekend, she haves school," said Iam.<br />
"Oh! My sister lives there too, I would like your sister, she must be a cutie, how many years old is she?" asked Júlia while smiling.<br />
"She is twelve years old, I'll tell you when she's in town okay?" asked Iam.<br />
"Okay, thanks, well, I gotta go, it was nice to talk with you again," replied Júlia while smiling.<br />
"It was nice to see you too, Júlia," said Iam smiling.<br />
Then they both followed their ways, Júlia arrived at the park and sat there for some minutes, feeling the soft wind and hearing the trees, drinking her water sometimes.<br />
Júlia then started walking back home, she was happy about her walk and feeling great, she was happy that she talked with Iam.<br />
The girl arrived at home, she unlocked the front door and walked to the bedroom, removing the bottle of water from the backpack.<br />
Then she stored the backpack inside the wardrobe and walked to the kitchen, filling the bottle with water and storing it on the fridge.<br />
After that, she was a little tired, she locked the front door and walked to the bedroom, lying on the bed and sleeping.<br />
<br />
She slept for some hours, when she woke up it was six PM, Littletato has arrived.<br />
Júlia got up, walked to the bathroom, and washed her face, then she walked to the kitchen, Littletato changed herself.<br />
The couple was a little hungry, "Hey honey, what about we order a pizza?" asked Littletato to Júlia.<br />
"I think that sounds good honey," said Júlia.<br />
Then Littletato started looking at the catalog of the VegeIfood mobile app looking for a pizzeria, she found one and ordered a big Marguerita for her and Júlia.<br />
Júlia and Littletato sat on the couch, waiting for the pizza to arrive, Littletato had ordered a bottle of 2 Liters of Coca-cola too.<br />
The pizzeria where she ordered the pizza was Sabrosa Pizza, it had good reviews on the Internet.<br />
After some minutes of waiting, the pizza arrived, Littletato paid for it and grabbed the pizza and the bottle of Coca-cola.<br />
They both walked to the kitchen to eat, Littletato left the pizza on top of the table, she grabbed two plates and placed them on top of the table.<br />
Júlia grabbed two cups and opened the bottle of Coca-cola, filling the two cups with it.<br />
Littletato cut the pizza into twelve pieces, she placed two slices on each plate, then she closed the box of the pizza and sat at the table.<br />
Júlia also sat, she started eating the pizza along with Littletato, it was very delicious, the Coca-cola was deliciously cold too.<br />
"Hey honey, how was your day?" asked Littletato.<br />
"It was very good hon, I got all happy this morning because they accepted me on the job, I told you right?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yes, I remember honey," said Littletato.<br />
"And after that, I played some Osu! and got out for a walk, I started walking to the park close to the mall.<br />
In the middle of the way, I met with Iam, and we talked a little.<br />
I told him about the barbecue that we're gonna make with Vitória, he wanted to come, I said yes, is that okay with you hon?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yeah, it's okay honey, but you got to tell Vitória," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey, I'm gonna tell her after we finish eating, this pizza is so good honey," said Júlia while looking at the pizza.<br />
"I agree, it is very delicious, and even more delicious along with some Coca-cola," said Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Júlia.<br />
Then they continued eating, Júlia and Littletato finished eating, Júlia washed the dishes and Littletato helped her.<br />
<br />
After that, Littletato walked to the computer room, she turned on her computer and opened the Vegecloud website.<br />
(Vegecloud is a website where you can hear songs from artists and hear what the artists likes and reposts, you can upload your owns songs to it too.)<br />
She put to play a Dubstep song a little low, Júlia was sat on the couch of the living room, fiddling with her phone.<br />
Júlia said to Vitória that a friend of theirs was coming to the barbecue too, she said that through Vegesapp.<br />
Vitória said okay, and asked for the phone number of that friend, then Júlia sent a message to Littletato asking for Iam's phone number.<br />
Littletato sent the phone number to Júlia and she sent it to Vitória, Vitória and Iam started talking and knowing each other.<br />
Júlia then got up, she walked to the computer room and hugged Littletato's neck, kissing her cheek.<br />
"Hey, honey, I'm out of disposable shavers, do you think the convenience store is still open?" asked Júlia, it was eleven PM.<br />
"Yes, hon, I think it's open right now," said Littletato, who was in the computer, using the Vegecord computer app to check the news of the Vegecord servers of some games.<br />
Littletato also used Vegecord to talk to her friends online.<br />
"Oh, okay, I'm gonna go there honey, I'll lock the door okay?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Okay," said Littletato, who kissed Júlia's lips and smiled, Júlia then grabbed her purse and stored her smartphone in her pocket.<br />
She walked to the front door, got out of the house, and locked the front door, she started walking to the convenience store.<br />
When she got there, she entered the store and started looking for the personal hygiene section of the store.<br />
Júlia found some good disposable shavers and grabbed them, walking to the cashier, she paid for them and started walking home.<br />
She got home, opened the front door, and entered inside, locking the door and storing the shavers on the wardrobe.<br />
The girl walked to the computer room and kissed Littletato's lips, hugging her.<br />
After that, Júlia grabbed her smartphone from her pocket and walked to the living room, sitting on the couch and turning the TV on.<br />
Littletato was using the Veggepad website to write a story of her, that story was called Kezzakam.<br />
Carol and Iam liked to read Kezzakam, they thought that it was a very good and interesting story.<br />
They loved to receive a notification on Vegebook saying that a new chapter of Kezzakam was published.<br />
Littletato also liked to post her digital drawings on the Vegiantart website, the things she drew on the Paint Tool SAI software program.<br />
The girl also liked to use the Vegewitter website, it is a website where you can follow famous people to see what they post and follow companies to see new products or things.<br />
She liked to post Vegeweets sometimes too, saying what she is feeling, and what she thinks about the world.<br />
Littletato also liked to read the Vegeweets from game companies, to see the news about new games being launched.<br />
Júlia also had a Vegewitter, she liked to read Littletato's Vegeweets.<br />
The couple was a little tired, Littletato wrote some words of her story called Kezzakam, Júlia was accepted on the job.<br />
Littletato turned off her computer, Júlia turned off the TV and walked to the bedroom, Littletato did that too.<br />
Júlia left her phone charging on the wall socket, they both laid on the bed and hugged tight, sleeping in the cold night.<br />
<br />

		It was a Friday, Júlia had to work today, but only at ten AM, Júlia woke up first, did her morning needs and walked to the kitchen.<br />
The girl prepared breakfast, she was happy because she was going to work on a new job today, she thought that it was going to be hard to learn, but she was eager to learn.<br />
Júlia woke up Littletato, she did her morning needs, and walked to the kitchen, they ate breakfast together.<br />
Littletato prepared herself to go to work, "Oh, honey, you have work today right?" asked Littletato while putting on her shoes<br />
"Yes, but only at ten AM," said Júlia.<br />
"Okay honey, I'm gonna bring a packed lunch for me to eat at work today at lunchtime," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay, hon," replied Júlia.<br />
Then Littletato walked to the front door, Júlia hugged and kissed her, Littletato kissed back and opened the door, she locked the door and started walking to work.<br />
Júlia stretched herself, she walked to the kitchen and drank some water, then she stored her bottle of water in the fridge again.<br />
After that, Júlia walked to the computer room and turned on Littletato's computer, she logged in on her computer account.<br />
Then the girl opened the Vegefox web browser, she put to play a Dubstep playlist of hers on the Vegecloud website, she was dancing a little and smiling.<br />
She started searching on the Internet on how to work in a supermarket, and what you have to do there.<br />
Júlia learned a lot about the job, she looked at the computer clock, it was seven AM.<br />
The girl continued to learn about the supermarket job, she wrote the things she learned on a text file on the computer to remember them easily.<br />
After that, Júlia was a little hungry, she wanted to watch something too, like an anime.<br />
Littletato had coded a Python script called Watch_History.py, which made it possible for the user to register what it watched on text files.<br />
By just selecting the media type (anime, cartoon, series, movie, video), and typing the media name.<br />
Júlia made a sandwich made of artificial meat hamburger, melted cheese, and mayonnaise, there was a can of Coca-cola on the refrigerator door.<br />
She opened the can of Coca-cola and grabbed the plate with the sandwich, walking to the computer room.<br />
Júlia opened an anime website where she watched anime, she started using it in 2013.<br />
The girl put to play an episode of the anime called "Yuru Camp", she and Littletato watched it some months ago.<br />
She started watching it while eating the sandwich and drinking the can of Coca-cola.<br />
It was very relaxing and fun, she loved to watch that anime, after some minutes, the episode ended, it was seven and thirty AM.<br />
<br />
Júlia stretched a little, she opened the Watch_History.py Python script, typed two, and pressed enter, she selected two again and selected the media type.<br />
Then she typed the media name, which was the name of the episode of the anime, then it was registered on Júlia's watched media text files.<br />
After that, Júlia brought the plate and can of Coca-cola to the kitchen, she placed the plate on the sink and the can on the recyclable plastic bag.<br />
She wanted to play something, Júlia closed the web browser, she opened the game called Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare.<br />
Júlia opened the Warzone mode of the game, which was the Battle Royale version of COD: MW.<br />
The girl played some matches of the game for some hours while drinking water and eating when she was hungry.<br />
After playing for a while, it was nine AM, she turned off the computer and prepared her things to go to work, prepared her purse, her smartphone was charging.<br />
She changed herself and grabbed her smartphone, it was nine and a half AM, she told Littletato that she was going to work.<br />
Littletato said okay, Júlia walked to the front door, stored her smartphone in her purse, and grabbed the spare key of the house.<br />
Júlia opened the door and got out, closing it, then she began walking to her work while looking sometimes on the GPS of her smartphone to know where it was.<br />
After walking for some minutes, Júlia arrived at the supermarket called Safeway, she entered the establishment.<br />
She talked to the manager saying that it was her first time working there, and also in a supermarket job.<br />
Júlia was going to work as a supermarket replenisher, she is responsible for stocking and maintaining shelves and displays in the supermarket.<br />
The girl has to ensure that all shelves and displays are well stocked and are visually appealing.<br />
She has to place the products that are closest to expiry at the front of the displays.<br />
Júlia also disposed of the cardboard boxes and packaging as the products were transferred from the pallets to the shelves and display units following the supermarket's procedures.<br />
The girl worked there for some hours, she had a lunchtime, she ate in a restaurant close to there, then she worked a little more, it was six PM.<br />
She finished her work and walked home, her salary was $10.89 per hour or $1,815 per month, it was very good, she was paid bi-weekly and was going to receive $824 bi-weekly.<br />
Júlia was a little tired, she arrived home and opened the front door, Littletato had arrived already.<br />
"Oh, hey honey, you're back from work," said Littletato, who was sat at the kitchen table, she had prepared the dinner already.<br />
"I'm just gonna take a bath and we eat okay honey?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Okay hon," replied Littletato, then Júlia left her purse on the couch, she walked to the kitchen.<br />
"Put my phone on to charge love?" asked Júlia, who kissed the cheek of Littletato, "Okay sweetie," replied Littletato.<br />
Then Júlia walked to the bedroom, she prepared herself to take a bath, took a bath and wore some clothes, then she ate dinner alongside Littletato.<br />
<br />
After that, Júlia stretched a little, she hugged Littletato and kissed her lips, smiling.<br />
"I'm gonna play a game okay hon?" asked Littletato, Júlia replied ok, then Littletato walked to the computer room and turned her computer on.<br />
She was going to play COD: MW, the Warzone mode of it, Júlia started to wash the dishes, after some minutes, she finished washing them.<br />
Júlia then grabbed her phone which was charging in the wall socket of the bedroom, removing the charger from the socket.<br />
The girl walked to the computer room, she sat at the side of Littletato, looking at her playing.<br />
After that, Júlia turned the screen of her phone on, she looked at her notifications, Júlia replied to some messages on Vegesapp.<br />
She told Vitória that today was her first day at work, Vitória was very happy about that, she sent a smile emoji to Júlia.<br />
The manager of the supermarket said that they pay every two weeks, every Friday.<br />
Júlia was happy about her first job, she was excited to work again on Monday.<br />
The girl opened her laptop which was on top of the table, she turned it on and opened the Mozilla Vegefox web browser.<br />
She opened the Vegecloud website to listen to some songs, Júlia had a playlist of Dubstep songs she liked, she put it to play, using her earphones.<br />
Júlia had the Paint Tool SAI program installed on her laptop, the one Littletato used to teach her how to draw digitally.<br />
She had some .sai files saved on her computer, she needed to make the line art of them to draw.<br />
The girl opened a drawing of a flower that she was making, she continued making the line art of it.<br />
Littletato was on her third match of the game, she was very good at it, and had made many kills.<br />
There was a calm song playing on Vegecloud, Júlia was listening to it while drawing, she was using the mouse because the touchpad was bad for drawing.<br />
Júlia and Littletato kept doing their things, playing, and drawing while listening to songs.<br />
It was ten PM, Littletato was now playing some Vegerraria, it was a survival game, like Vegecraft, but two-dimensional, she had a house in it and some NPCs lived in that house.<br />
Júlia had made a lot of progress on her drawing, she finished the line art and painted a little, she was now playing Osu!, a rhythm game.<br />
She had to click on circles to the beat of the song that was playing, the range of difficulty was measured by stars, they ranged from one to ten.<br />
Júlia could play up to four stars, she thought that she was very good at the game, and was very confident in her skills.<br />
The girl played some songs and stretched a little, Littletato and her were a little tired, they turned off their computers and walked to the bedroom, sleeping and hugging tight.<br />
<br />
Littletato was dreaming about a green field of grass, the grass was moving with the wind, it was very fresh there.<br />
Júlia was there with her, they were wearing beautiful dresses, Júlia was wearing a light-blue one, Littletato was wearing a dark-gray dress, they were kids in that dream.<br />
They both started to walk towards a castle, looked like that castle was abandoned for some hundreds of years.<br />
The couple started walking inside the castle, it was very dark, they had to walk by holding on walls.<br />
After some minutes of walking, they started feeling a little nauseated, they fell on the ground and blacked out.<br />
Then, they found themselves sat at a table, there was a woman there, she had white hair color, a black iris, and white pupils.<br />
She said that her name was Echidna and that she was the Witch of Greed.<br />
There was tea on the table, there was an open umbrella above the table too.<br />
Littletato and Júlia thought that they should not trust a witch and her tea, they did not drink the tea.<br />
Echidna said that they needed to do a trial to remove the magical barrier of someplace, so some hybrid creatures could leave that place.<br />
They said that they did not know where that place was and that they were not there to do that, Echidna looked a little disappointed.<br />
After that, the couple got up, they started walking in the opposite direction where the witch was, there was the hallway of that dark castle.<br />
They walked more and more in the dark, holding each other's hands and putting their hands on the walls.<br />
Júlia and Littletato got out of the castle, they stood on the stairs of the castle, there was a tall and huge Titan rushing to the castle.<br />
The tip of the castle was of the same height as the neck of the Titan, it had brown armors on all parts of his body except for the moving parts.<br />
It had gray hair and yellow eyes, it roared and continued rushing towards the castle, then another Titan with medium black hair and green eyes appeared by his left, punching his face.<br />
The two began to fight, Júlia and Littletato knew the names of them, they were Reiner and Eren, Eren was winning.<br />
Júlia and Littletato continued walking, there was a man with a white coat, looking like a scientist, a redhead woman was accompanying him.<br />
Then the couple looked to their right, there was a black-haired boy with a black and a light-blue sword, and a redhead girl with a white sword.<br />
They were Kirito and Asuna, and they fought in the Aincrad virtual world, using a VR device called NerveGear.<br />
After that, Littletato and Júlia continued walking on that green field, they were hearing a song called "Torch of Liberty" by an artist called KANA-BOON.<br />
That was a very weird dream, they saw a pink-haired boy being angry and breathing fire from his mouth, with a talking blue cat by his side, a blond girl with keys, and a dark-blue-haired boy who could make ice with his hands.<br />
They saw a pink-haired girl with some weird loose clothes like they were alien clothes, it had a creature flying close to her, it had bat wings.<br />
An orange-haired boy was close to her, a brown-haired girl which was his sister, and a blue-haired girl, the blue-haired girl said "Rito?"<br />
Walking a little more, Littletato and Júlia saw a dark-blue-haired girl camping, she had mounted her tent and was reading a book close to her campfire.<br />
She had made yakisoba and kiritanpo for her, she had a portable campfire, the couple was happy to see her camping, her name was Rin, Rin liked to camp alone.<br />
There was a pink-haired girl who was very energetic, she was camping too, alone, a little far away from Rin.<br />
Then the dream changed to another dream, the couple continued to sleep together and dream other dreams.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 26/02/2019.<br />
And finished revising it on 19/02/2021.<br />
I finished revising chapter number 19 on day 19 :).<br />
<br />
It was very good revising this chapter, I was very happy about it, searching for how salary is paid in the United States, and writing about the anime references in the last part.<br />
I revised this chapter while listening to the "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs4qzCzJTKk" target="_blank">Yuru Camp soundtrack</a>".<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZIqgCHrhRM" target="_blank" class="text_light_salmon text_hover_light_salmon">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZIqgCHrhRM</a><br />
I also listened to a mix of anime openings, they are very good, I like the Bunny Girl Senpai one.<br />

The girl walked to the computer room, sitting on her office chair with wheels, it was very comfortable.<br />
She turned her computer on and waited for it to boot up, after some seconds, it boots up.<br />

The girl turned it on, the light on its dashboard was very bright and beautiful.<br />
She put the car on the first shift, it has been some time since she drove a car, but she remembered how to do it.<br />
Littletato started taking her left foot off the clutch and started putting her right foot on the accelerator gently.<br />
The guy who gave her the key to the car said "It's all yours," with his arm on top of the space where the door window would be if it was closed.<br />
<br />

Littletato was happy while listening to the music, she arrived at the supermarket, parking her golden car in the parking lot in front of the supermarket.<br />
She turned off the Bluetooth of her phone and put on her earphones, plugging them on the phone, listening to the same song on repeat.<br />

Littletato waited for the woman to pack the things and paid her, saying thanks with a smile, leaving the supermarket while holding the bags.<br />
She walked to her car, pressing the button on the car key and entering inside it through the driver's door.<br />
The girl left the bags on top of the passenger's seat, turning the car on and turning the Bluetooth of her phone on.<br />
Littletato started driving, she got out of the parking lot and started driving home, she stopped at a traffic light and programmed the GPS to go there.<br />
A lot of people looked at her smiling, a kid said "Look mom, that car is so beautiful!" while pointing to Littletato's car.<br />

Then the traffic light was green, she released the clutch smoothly and accelerated, continuing to drive home.<br />
Littletato was so happy to drive that car around the city, it was so beautiful and fast, it could reach more than 350 km/h (or 217 MPH).<br />
<br />
After some minutes of driving, she arrived home, parking the car in front of her house, accelerating it, and making noise, Júlia got out of the house to see the new car.<br />

"Thanks, hon, hehe," said Littletato, the music was still playing, Júlia danced a little while listening to it, Littletato smiled and giggled a little.<br />
She lowered the volume and told Júlia to grab the bags, saying please, she unlocked the right door of the car.<br />
Júlia opened the right door and grabbed the bags, closing the door, and walking inside the house with them.<br />
Littletato grabbed her phone and her purse, putting on her earphones and plugging them on the phone, listening to the same song from before.<br />
She closed the door of the Lamborghini and pressed the alarm button on the car keys, locking the car.<br />
Then Littletato walked inside the house, closing the front door, she walked to the bedroom and changed herself.<br />
Júlia was already eating the artificial chocolate that Littletato bought, "Already hon?" asked Littletato, looking at Júlia.<br />
"I'm sowwy hon," said Júlia with an innocent and sad face, "You're very gluttonous my sweetheart," said Littletato, hugging Júlia and kissing her cheek.<br />
Júlia smiled and continued biting her chocolate, "Give me one," said Littletato, biting the chocolate, "Of course honey, hehe," said Júlia, kissing Littletato's lips.<br />
"When you're going to take me for a ride, hon?" asked Júlia, "Tomorrow hon," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey," said Júlia, hugging Littletato, it was eight PM, Littletato placed the car key on the wall key chain.<br />
"I bought two bottles of Coca-cola of three liters each.<br />

Tomorrow we'll wake up at eight AM and get them out of the freezer to season all but the garlic bread and the sausages," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey, hehe," said Júlia, smiling, she stored her chocolate bar on the fridge and they started making dinner together.<br />
After some minutes, they finished making dinner, they ate together, then Littletato and Júlia walked to the living room to watch some Yuru Camp anime episodes.<br />
They watched for a while and did their night necessities, then they walked to the bedroom and laid on the bed, hugging tight and sleeping.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 31/03/2019.<br />
And I finished revising it on 08/03/2021.<br />
No coincidences besides the month number today.<br />
<br />
It was very good to revise this chapter, I revised it while listening to the Yuru Camp anime soundtrack.<br />
And also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpNYYkXxT-A" target="_blank">"Take That" by RIOT</a>.<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpNYYkXxT-A" target="_blank" class="text_light_salmon text_hover_light_salmon">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpNYYkXxT-A</a><br />
I was very happy, talking about the coffee of Littletato and Júlia, in the coffee shop where they first met.<br />
The relaxing bath of Júlia and Littletato, Littletato and Júlia playing games.<br />
The part where Littletato got a taxi to go get her car, and when she started driving it, it was so fun, with that song playing.<br />
I searched a lot of pictures of Lamborghini Aventador to see and feel that part of the story.<br />
It was so much fun, Littletato making noise with the car, and the kid talking about it, Littletato arriving at her neighborhood with her car, in style.<br />
The preparation for tomorrow's barbecue was also fun to write it.<br />
Thank you so much for reading this chapter :3.)

After that, Littletato ground fresh black pepper on the meat, she left the meat resting on a bowl at room temperature.<br />

It was a game about cooking and delivering the cooked dishes, it was a coop game, it was funny and had challenging maps.<br />
One player had to give the ingredients and the other player had to get the ingredients and cook the dishes.<br />
Littletato grabbed one controller for Iam, they started playing, they laughed while playing, laughing about the things they got wrong, like throwing a dish at the sea.<br />
After some minutes, Vitória and Júlia appeared there, they brought some meat slices and two cups of Coca-cola for Littletato and Iam.<br />
"Thanks, honey," said Littletato, "No problem," said Júlia smiling.<br />
Iam said thanks to Vitória and she said no problem.<br />
Then Iam and Littletato continued playing Overcooked 2 while drinking Coca-cola and eating meat with forks.<br />
After a while, Vitória and Júlia wanted to play too, Littletato grabbed two more controllers and gave them to them.<br />
The four played together, the game was good and funny, they laughed while playing it.<br />
Littletato was happy about the barbecue, it was very delicious, she loved to drink Coca-cola while eating barbecue.<br />
Júlia was happy too, she liked to have Vitória and Iam there to spend some time with them.<br />
After playing for some time, it was eleven AM, Littletato was a little tired, Júlia too, both of them stretched a little.<br />
"Hey guys, how about we go for a walk in the park?" asked Vitória.<br />
"Oh, that seems fun," replied Iam, smiling a little, "I have to stretch my legs for a while, so that's good," he continued.<br />
Then Littletato grabbed the controllers, she stored three of them on a part of the living room shelf, then she placed hers on top of the Vbox One.<br />
She turned the video game off and stretched a little, Iam grabbed his wallet, Vitória, Júlia, and Littletato grabbed their purses.<br />
The four got out of the house, Littletato, and Júlia in the front, Vitória behind Júlia and Iam behind Vitória.<br />
Littletato locked the door and turned right, starting to walk in the direction where the park was.<br />
The three started walking together with Littletato, they got side by side with each other and began talking.<br />
"The barbecue was very great right?" asked Littletato, "Yes, it was very good honey, Vitória is a great cooker," said Júlia, smiling, looking at Vitória.<br />
"Aw, thanks, you guys," said Vitória, smiling while blushing a little.<br />
"And the gaming session was very fun, why that game is so funny and good to play with friends?" asked Iam, curious.<br />
"I think it is because you can do wrong things in it, like throwing the food off or something," said Littletato, giggling a little.<br />
"And when you see your friend doing that, it is funny, and you laugh together," continued Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, I agree, hehe," said Iam, then they stayed silent for a moment.<br />
"Sundays are fun right, you have your day free, and you can do anything you want, it's good..." said Littletato, looking at the sky while walking.<br />
"Yeah, and you can do fun things, spend your day playing, go for a walk in the park," said Júlia smiling, "Eat delicious foods," continued her, smirking while looking at Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Littletato with a genuine and innocent smile.<br />
They continued walking towards the park while looking at the scenery, the conversation died a little.<br />
"So... How your boyfriend is, Vitória? Is he doing alright?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, he's alright, but he is working today, he is a manager of a company, it's rare for him to work on Saturdays and Sundays, but it happens," said Vitória, looking a little sad.<br />
"Oh... I'm sorry," said Littletato, thinking that she ruined the mood.<br />
"No, it's okay Littletato," said Vitória, smiling again, "It's good to spend some time with you guys," continued her.<br />
<br />
Then they arrived at the park, Júlia ran a little and jumped, she liked the park, so full of energy and fresh air.<br />
Littletato and Júlia found a good place to sit, they sat below a tree which provided them a good shadow.<br />
The four sat down there, Littletato and Júlia together, Vitória at the left side of Júlia, and Iam at the left side of Vitória.<br />
They laid their heads on the ground, looking at the sky.<br />
"Sometimes is good to relax like this, spend some time just thinking and looking at nature," said Littletato, holding Júlia's hand.<br />
"Yeah, I agree, sometimes we need to reconnect with nature, and feel the breeze and fresh air," said Vitória, who gave a relaxed sigh.<br />
The three sighed in unison, closing their eyes and relaxing for a while, feeling the breeze, the wind, and the fresh air they were breathing.<br />
After forty minutes laying there, relaxing, the four got up, they saw some kids playing Frisbee, they smiled at that.<br />
Littletato suggested for them to go home, it was mid-day, they started walking home while talking again.<br />
"We ate pretty early right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, I only said that I was going to arrive at eight AM because I thought that the barbecue was going to take some time to get done.<br />
I guess I wasn't confident enough in my skills, hehe," said Vitória, smiling a little.<br />
"Yeah, you're a very good cooker, sis," said Júlia, smiling, Vitória said thanks while smiling too.<br />
Then after some minutes of walking, they arrived home, Littletato opened the door, Iam and Vitória sat on the couch.<br />
Littletato and Júlia stretched a little, Littletato said that she was going to take a bath, Júlia turned the Vbox One on.<br />
She logged into a spare account on the video game and gave the controller to Iam and another one to Vitória.<br />
Vitória and Iam started playing a little, they were playing a coop game called A Way Out.<br />
Júlia entered the bathroom, Júlia and Littletato started to take a bath together.<br />
<br />
"This game is fun, I wanted to play it since I watched it on Alanzoka's Vegetube channel," said Iam, smiling, he chose the character called Leo.<br />
"Oh, you know Alanzoka too?" asked Vitória, curious and a little surprised, "Yes, I watch his Livestreams every time that I can," replied Iam.<br />
"What is your favorite series of him?" asked Vitória.<br />
"I think it is the Far Cry Five one because that's how I knew about the game, and the game is very good," replied Iam.<br />
"Right? I love that game," said Vitória, smiling.<br />
"Me too, hehe," said Iam.<br />
Then they continued playing A Way Out, Vitória chose Vincent, cause he was the only character left to choose because Iam already had chosen Leo.<br />
Littletato and Júlia finished bathing, they wore some clothes and got out of the bathroom, they walked to the living room and sat on the couch.<br />
They began to watch Iam and Vitória play for a while, it was one PM.<br />
"Hey, do you guys want afternoon breakfast?" asked Littletato to Iam and Vitória.<br />
"Oh, yes, please Littletato," said Iam, smiling.<br />
"I would like that a whole bunch," said Vitória.<br />
Then Vitória paused the game, she placed her controller close to the Vbox One console which was on top of the living room shelf.<br />
Iam did the same, the four walked to the kitchen, Iam and Vitória sat at the table.<br />
Littletato and Júlia set up the table for them, they grabbed some slices of bread, butter, and cheese for them.<br />
They placed the cheese, butter, and bread on top of the table, they also grabbed some plates for them, and also a knife.<br />
Iam and Vitória grabbed two slices of bread each, they passed some butter and placed one cheese slice on them.<br />
Littletato and Júlia made one cup of chocolate milk for Iam and one for Vitória.<br />
The couple made their meals and cups of chocolate milk, they sat at the table to eat.<br />
It was very delicious, it was good to eat with friends, they both ate while drinking too.<br />
After that, the four walked to the living room and sat on the couch, they played a little together, drinking water sometimes.<br />
Then, it was time for Iam and Vitória to go home, it was five PM, Littletato and Júlia said goodbye to Iam and Vitória.<br />
Vitória placed her barbecue grill on the back of her car, she had an SUV.<br />
<br />
Júlia hugged Vitória while giving goodbye to her, then they walked inside the house, Littletato logged out of the spare Vbox One account.<br />
She stored the spare controller and turned the video game off, Júlia started to wash the dishes.<br />
Littletato drank some water, she walked to the kitchen and hugged Júlia from behind, she kissed her neck.<br />
"That tickles honey, hehe," said Júlia, smiling, "Hehe, the barbecue was very fun right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, the walk to the park, and playing with them," said Júlia, washing the dishes, "I agree honey," said Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato helped her with the dishes, they both got out of the house, Littletato had the key of the car.<br />
She locked the front door of the house and walked to the car, unlocking it with a button on the car's key.<br />
Littletato entered the car and Júlia too, Littletato got out of the parking lot and started driving through the city with her golden car.<br />
She drove fast so Júlia could feel the speed of the car and feel the wind.<br />
"Whoa hon, you're going so fast, hehe," said Júlia, smiling, she was having fun with the ride.<br />
Littletato stopped by a gas station to refill the tank of the car, then she continued driving around the city.<br />
"Hey honey, I think I want to do a trip with you with this car," said Littletato, driving.<br />
"A trip? To where hon?" asked Júlia, looking at her, smiling.<br />
"To Texas, hehe, what do you think?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think it's a great idea hon, hehe, and you could go visit your aunt Luisa right?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Littletato, driving.<br />
"I'm liking this ride hon, hehe," said Júlia, smiling, "I'm glad you're liking it hon," said Littletato.<br />
Then, Littletato continued driving, she drove home and parked the car there, they both got out of the car and Littletato locked it.<br />
It was six PM, they entered the house and locked it, Littletato and Júlia started making dinner together.<br />
After some minutes, they finished making dinner, they heated the meat and sausages from the barbecue and ate them with rice, beans, and some garlic bread.<br />
It was very delicious, it reminded them of the time they spent together with Iam and Vitória.<br />
Then, they finished eating, after that, they walked to the living room and sat on the couch.<br />
Littletato opened the Vegeflix app on the TV and opened one episode of a series to watch with Júlia.<br />
They watched that episode while hugging, after some time, they were tired, Littletato turned off the TV and they walked to the bedroom.<br />
Júlia and Littletato laid on the bed, they hugged tight and closed their eyes, sleeping on a cold night.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 14/04/2019.<br />
And finished revising it on 15/03/2021.<br />
<br />
It was good to revise, I just loved to write this chapter.<br />
I loved to write about barbecue, I searched about how to make meat and garlic bread for barbecue.<br />
I also loved to write about Iam arriving, him and Júlia making the rice and beans, Littletato making the salad of artificial vegetables.<br />
The lunch that they had with the delicious barbecue, the walk to the park.<br />
The four talking while walking to the park, I began to see more of Littletato, and know more about her too, and how she acts and talks.<br />
I liked to write about Iam and Vitória playing together and their talk.<br />
About them making the afternoon breakfast, it reminds me of when I got to the house of my relatives, like my aunts and my grandma, and they serve afternoon breakfast for us.<br />
I loved to write about Littletato wanting to go to Texas, and her ride with Júlia<br />
Anyway, thank you so much for reading this chapter, come again soon, hehe ^^.)

		It was a Thursday, Littletato was alone in her room, she had twelve years old and was playing some Vegecraft on her computer.<br />
She lived in the house of her parents, her father was called John, her mother was called Ana, they were very caring parents.<br />
Littletato thought she had a good life, she lived in Los Angeles with her parents and her sister Carol, Carol had ten years old.<br />
John had brown hair and Ana had blond hair, that is why Carol is blond and Littletato has brown hair.<br />
The girl was playing some Vegecraft, her father had a great house in Los Angeles, it had three bedrooms, a good bathroom, and a big kitchen.<br />
Carol had her room, Littletato too, but Carol liked to sleep with Littletato sometimes, they were very close sisters.<br />
Littletato wanted to be a traveler like her father, he traveled around cities to know his country a little more, and to know about other places.<br />
Sometimes John took her on a trip, she has been to Concord, Nevada City, and San Diego, she thought those were great cities.<br />
Her father bought her artificial chocolates, chips, and savory, she had fun on those trips.<br />
John taught her a lot of things about cars, motorcycles, and how to do a trip, how to prepare for a trip, Littletato liked to learn with her father.<br />
Carol also had a lot of attention from her parents, she wanted to work as a nutritionist, to teach people about food, and to also learn about food.<br />
She thought that we should think about what we eat and what that causes us and changes in our bodies.<br />
The girl liked to play video games and games on her computer, her father bought a Vbox 360 for both of them to play, it was in the living room.<br />
Carol liked to play with Littletato, they played a lot of games together and had fun.<br />
Littletato also had a brother called Ted, but he disappeared at a young age.<br />
She had a sister called Lisa too, she also disappeared at a young age.<br />
Littletato's parents did not know how they disappeared, they were worried.<br />
The two thought they disappeared because of paranormal or supernatural phenomena.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
It was a Monday, Littletato woke up, in the year 2019, it was April, she had nineteen years old Littletato got out of bed.<br />
She did her morning necessities, the girl was in the bathroom, brushing her teeth while looking at the mirror.<br />

She walked to the bedroom and grabbed her stuff to take a bath, then the girl walked to the bathroom, she took a bath, it was five and a half AM.<br />
The girl walked to the kitchen, she grabbed the artificial ham and cheese, placed them on top of the table, and grabbed the bread, starting to make breakfast.<br />
Littletato grabbed two gray plates of porcelain, placed two slices of bread on each plate, cutting some ham, and grabbing a slice of cheese.<br />
She placed the slices of ham and cheese on top of the two slices of bread, closing the sandwiches.<br />
Then she made two cups of chocolate milk, one for her and one for Júlia, she prepared the table, then walked to the bedroom to wake up Júlia.<br />
Júlia woke up and got out of bed, she did her morning necessities and walked to the kitchen to eat with Littletato.<br />
The couple ate and drank together while talking a little.<br />
"Hey honey, I think I'm gonna take a day off to travel to Texas with you, what do you think about that?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think that's good honey, are we gonna go with your golden car?" asked Júlia, smiling.<br />
"Of course honey, hehe," replied Littletato, smiling.<br />
"We have to take a pic when we are on the way to post on the Vegesapp status, and also buy some chips, candies, savories, artificial chocolates, right hon?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, I love to eat those things while traveling, hehe, it reminds me of the time I traveled around California with my family.<br />
My cousins, friends, my dad, and my mom, I was traveling in a van, ah... Some good memories," said Júlia, smiling while looking at the ceiling.<br />
"Yes, I want to travel with you hon," said Littletato, putting her hand above Júlia's.<br />
"Me too hon, let's do it!" replied Júlia, smiling.<br />
Then they finished eating breakfast, it was very good.<br />
<br />
After that, Littletato and her washed the dishes, Júlia put her phone to charge in the bedroom.<br />
Littletato sent a message to the Vegesapp account of her work to say that she was going to take a day off.<br />
They replied saying okay and said that she was going to get paid, like a paid holiday.<br />
She smiled and turned her phone's screen off, it was six AM.<br />
"Hey honey, I'm gonna fill up the tank of the car, I think it was almost out of fuel yesterday," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey," said Júlia, then Littletato grabbed the car keys and got out of the house, she locked the door.<br />
Littletato unlocked the car and entered inside it, turning it on, she started driving to the closest gas station.<br />
Júlia started taking a bath, she thought of what Texas looked like, she has never been there, she thought about the foods they were going to eat on the trip.<br />
After some minutes, Littletato arrived at the gas station, she filled up the car's tank, she paid in debt using her credit card.<br />
Then, Littletato drove back to the house, she parked the car on the parking lot, getting out of it and locking it.<br />
Littletato unlocked the front door and entered the house, Júlia had finished her bath, Littletato started hers.<br />
Júlia was combing her hair, she was sat on the couch in the living room, she turned the Vbox One on to play some Titanfall 2.<br />
She liked that game, it was very fun and cool, Littletato was taking her relaxing bath.<br />
Then, Littletato was out of the bathroom, she changed herself and combed her hair, Júlia closed the game and turned off the Vbox One.<br />
Littletato was ready, Júlia too, she grabbed a Doritos pack and two cans of Coca-cola from the fridge.<br />
"Oh, honey, get a cooler for the cans, I think Texas is a little hotter than San Francisco," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay hon," said Júlia, who grabbed the blue cooler and placed the two Coca-cola cans inside it, she walked to the bedroom and grabbed her phone, storing it in her pocket.<br />
Then she came back to the kitchen, Littletato gave the car keys to her, she got out of the house while holding the blue cooler.<br />

<br />
After driving for some time, they got out of the city and were on a highway, Júlia turned her phone on, she turned the Bluetooth on too.<br />
The girl put to play some highway and trip songs on Vegetify and connected her phone to the car's radio.<br />
Both of them danced and sang the songs while looking at the scenery and nature.<br />
The soundtrack of the Yuru Camp anime started playing, it had some country and nature style, it was very good.<br />
Júlia and Littletato listened to it, it had an energetic banjo playing, they liked that kind of music.<br />
"I love this soundtrack hon!" said Júlia, smiling.<br />
"Me too honey, hehe, I even try singing the ending of the anime sometimes," said Littletato smiling.<br />
"Are you hungry hon?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Just a little, do you wanna open the Doritos packet?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, hehe," replied Júlia, who grabbed the Doritos packet from the bag on her feet and opened it, she ate one Doritos.<br />
Then she brought one close to Littletato's mouth, Littletato opened her mouth and ate it.<br />
"So good, hehe, can you grab the cooler on the back hon?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Of course honey," replied Júlia, then she grabbed the cooler from the back, placing it on her lap.<br />
She opened it and grabbed one can of Coca-cola, opening it, making a gas sound.<br />
Júlia drank some sips of it and gave it to Littletato, she also drank some sips of it.<br />
"Refreshingly cold, hehe," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Júlia.<br />
The couple was getting close to Los Angeles, they were eating Doritos and drinking Coca-cola, it was seven and forty AM.<br />
Littletato thought about buying more food and drinks in Los Angeles when they arrive there, she continued driving.<br />
<br />
Then, after driving for a while, Littletato and Júlia arrived in Los Angeles by car, they paid for the toll.<br />
Upon entering the city, they saw the Hollywood big sign, it was beautiful to see.<br />
They continued driving around the city, Littletato looked for a gas station to refuel her golden Lamborghini.<br />
She found one and drove to it, stopped there, and refilled the tank of the car, she paid for the fuel.<br />
After that, Littletato began driving to a supermarket called Target, which is part of the Target supermarkets franchise.<br />

Then, Littletato locked the car, the couple began walking inside the supermarket.<br />
"Let's buy some biscuits, chips, and some drinks okay hon?" asked Littletato to Júlia.<br />

She wished Júlia a safe and good trip, Júlia said thanks with a smiley emoji.<br />
Then Littletato continued driving, Júlia programmed the GPS to go to Texas, she saw that they were going to pass inside Flagstaff.<br />
Júlia opened the packet of Lay's, she ate some and gave some in Littletato's mouth.<br />

It was very good revising this chapter, I loved it.<br />
It was good writing about the childhood of Littletato, how she lived with her parents and her sister.<br />
And how she was with her sister when she was eleven years old.<br />
The fact that Littletato got her passion for traveling from her father.<br />
The blue cooler that they got to store the cans and the bottle of Coca-cola, reminded me of the Over The Hedge movie.<br />
And also reminded me of the American culture of beers and cans and coolers, chips, sodas, all that stuff.<br />
I liked writing about them buying the various chips, chocolates, and other stuff to eat.<br />
I searched on the Internet for famous chocolate, biscuits, and chip brands of the United States.<br />
I opened Google Maps to look for the route from San Francisco to Texas, it is a one-day trip by car, and it takes five hours and twenty-five minutes by plane.<br />
And I also liked listening to the Yuru Camp soundtrack while revising this chapter.<br />
Thank you for reading! Hehe ^^.)

		The adventures of Littletato's trip to Texas continue, thank you for tuning in again in our channel.<br />
Littletato was still driving to Texas, Júlia and she were listening to Yuru Camp's soundtrack on the car's radio.<br />
Some people looked at Littletato's car with amazement in their eyes, they had never seen a car so beautiful as that.<br />
The girl continued driving, following the GPS, Vitória sent a message to Júlia on her Vegesapp, asking where they were right now.<br />
Júlia replied her saying that they just left Flagstaff and are going towards Gallup in New Mexico.<br />
Vitória replied saying okay, she said that she was working, making a new logo for a company that sells compostable cups and dishware.<br />
Then, Júlia replied saying that it was cool and that she wanted to see the logo when it is finished, Vitória replied by saying okay.<br />
After that, Júlia opened the camera of her phone, she started recording the trip, and also Littletato driving.<br />
They were having fun on that trip, Littletato drove more, she wanted to stop by a gas station on Gallup to put some gasoline.<br />
Júlia was happy by traveling with Littletato, after some minutes of driving, they arrived at Gallup.<br />
Littletato stopped by a gas station to put some gasoline, she paid for it with debt, using her credit card.<br />
Then she began driving again, around Gallup, Littletato drove close to a flea market, she stopped the car there and got out of it with Júlia.<br />
Júlia and Littletato began walking around the market, they saw some taco and some artificial burgers, some pies and stews, they wanted to eat that.<br />
The couple walked close to the taco stand, they asked for two tacos, two sodas, and some Navajo burgers.<br />
After that, they sat at a table to wait, they waited for a while, Júlia sent a message to her sister saying that they were in Gallup now.<br />
Then, Littletato did the same for her sister.<br />
Littletato took a picture of the flea market of Gallup, after some minutes, their order arrived, the manager of the stand brought the food to them.<br />
They started eating the tacos and drinking the Vepsi soda, it was delicious, they loved the taste of the taco.<br />
Júlia thought it was very good, she liked the taste of the dough, they finished eating the taco.<br />
After that, the couple started eating the Navajo burgers that used artificial meat hamburgers while drinking the soda.<br />
Then, they finished eating, it was very delicious, they paid for the food and continued walking around the flea market.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Júlia walked for some minutes, then they walked back to the car, Littletato started driving around Gallup.<br />
The GPS told her to go to a road in Gallup to get out of it and continue her trip to Texas.<br />
Júlia took a picture of the flea market and posted it on her Vegesapp status.<br />
Littletato and Júlia were happy about the trip, they liked eating those tacos, burgers, and soda.<br />
They still had a lot of chips, chocolates, savory, and sweet biscuits, they did not want those because they were full.<br />
Littletato was out of Gallup, she continued driving towards Texas, looking at the GPS.<br />
The next city they were going to was Albuquerque in the state of New Mexico.<br />
Júlia hugged Littletato and smiled, Littletato thought about the trips she did with her dad around the country.<br />
She thought that they were very fun, she enjoyed them, she also thought about her childhood and when she played games with Carol.<br />
"Do you want to sleep a little hon?" asked Littletato, it was nine and a half AM.<br />
"No, I'm fine honey, don't worry," replied Júlia, kissing Littletato's cheek.<br />
"Okay then, hehe," said Littletato, smiling, with her hands on the steering wheel, the car was on automatic mode.<br />
Then, Júlia laid her head on Littletato's right arm, she closed her eyes and gave a relaxed sigh.<br />
Littletato caressed Júlia's hair a little, feeling the softness of it, "Aww, you can sleep here if you want hon," said Littletato smiling.<br />
"Hmm... Okay hon, thanks," said Júlia in a sleepy voice.<br />
Then Júlia began sleeping, Littletato continued driving to Albuquerque.<br />
She arrived there and passed through it, continuing the trip, the next city was Edgewood.<br />
After some hours, Littletato has come a long way, she passed through Moriarty, Clines Corners, Santa Rosa, the Summer Lake State Park where the Lake Summer resided.<br />
Littletato also passed through Fort Summer, Melrose, St Vrain, Clovis, Texico, Lubbock, and other small cities, it was eleven AM.<br />
<br />
The girl arrived in Texas, Júlia was awake, she drove to Houston, the biggest city of Texas, she began driving around the city.<br />
Houston had a chocolate bar population, there were all kinds of chocolate bars there.<br />
Black chocolate, white chocolate, some different ones like a black diamond one, a Kit Kat, and milk chocolate.<br />
Júlia and Littletato were happy to see the city, it looked good, they read that the city was very hot in the summer and cold in the winter.<br />
Littletato continued driving around the city, then she parked the car close to some shops, she wanted to see the things they sold.<br />
They walked to a clothes shop, the saleswoman of the clothes shop walked close to them to talk, she said her name was Layla, she had nineteen years old.<br />
"Hey, you guys aren't from here right?" asked Layla with a smile on her face.<br />
"Yes, we aren't, we're just here to visit, I'm Littletato," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, nice to meet you Littletato.<br />
There aren't many vegetable people around here, that's we know that they are tourists.<br />
The mayor of this city moved here with his family, other people moved too, it became a city.<br />
Take a look around the city, it is very good, I like living here," said Layla.<br />
"Okay, we're gonna take a look, thanks, hehe," replied Júlia, smiling.<br />
"No problem, hehe, are you guys a couple? Sorry for asking..." asked Layla.<br />
"Yes, we are, and don't worry," replied Littletato smiling.<br />
"Okay, hehe, can I add you guys on Vegebook?" asked Layla.<br />
Littletato and Júlia replied yes, then Layla added them on Vegebook.<br />
"We gonna go take a look at the city right now, okay?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay, hehe, travel safe," replied Layla, smiling.<br />
"Thanks, hehe," said Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato and Júlia came back to the car, Littletato started driving around the city again, it was eleven and a half AM.<br />
<br />
Littletato drove around the city, she programmed the GPS to go to a mall that Houston had.<br />
She drove some more, Júlia began eating the Doritos packet and began drinking a cup of Coca-cola.<br />
After that, Littletato asked for some Cheetos Crunchy, Júlia gave some on her mouth, she ate them and drank one cup of Coca-cola.<br />
There was some country music playing on the car's radio, Júlia liked that genre of music, it reminded her of home.<br />
Littletato also liked it, she turned the volume of the car's radio up a little.<br />
After some minutes of driving, they arrived at the Memorial City Mall, Littletato parked the car on the mall's parking lot, they got out of the car and Littletato locked it.<br />
They entered the mall and began walking around it, looking at the stores.<br />
Júlia walked to a clothes store, Littletato followed her, they both started looking at the clothes to see if there were the ones that they liked.<br />
They found some clothes and grabbed them, walking to the fitting room with them.<br />
Littletato and Júlia tested some clothes, they liked some of them, t-shirts, skirts, shorts, dresses, and pants.<br />
After that, they bought some clothes and got out of the store, they got out of the mall and stored the bags on the back seat of the car.<br />
Then, they walked back to the mall and continued seeing the stores, they walked to an electronics store.<br />
Júlia and Littletato began looking at the electronics, the TVs, computer screens, laptops, mouses, keyboards, video games, and games.<br />
They were amazed by seeing so many beautiful things, they loved technology, mainly Littletato.<br />
Littletato bought a good wireless headphone, she was going to pay for it in debt using her credit card.<br />
Júlia began walking around the store, she looked at the games on the games shelf, she had some experience in organizing products for customers because of her work.<br />
So she loved the way that the games were organized on the shelf, they were appealing and looked cool there.<br />
She was looking at the Vbox One games shelf, there were Titanfall 2, Overcooked 2, Grand Theft Auto V, and Far Cry 5.<br />
Littletato was paying for the headphones, she paid and walked to where Júlia was.<br />
"Do you want to buy any games hon?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, I think we never played GTA five right?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yes, do you wanna buy it?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes honey," replied Júlia.<br />
"Okay, hehe," said Littletato, who grabbed Grand Theft Auto V for Vbox One and placed it inside a plastic basket.<br />
Júlia smiled while looking at Littletato, then she walked around the store, she grabbed one wireless earbud and placed it inside the plastic basket.<br />
Then Littletato and Júlia walked back to the counter, Littletato paid for the purchase, they got out of the store.<br />
Littletato unlocked the car, placed the bag on the back seat of the car, then she sat on the driver's seat.<br />
Júlia sat on the passenger's seat, they began driving around Houston again, it was mid-day.<br />
<br />
They were a little hungry, and they were tired of eating bad things like chips and biscuits.<br />
Littletato drove to a restaurant, she parked the car in the parking lot, Júlia and her got out of the car and entered the restaurant.<br />
"How many are in your party?" asked the hostess.<br />
"Two," replied Littletato.<br />
"Follow me, please," said the hostess.<br />
They followed the hostess, Júlia and Littletato sat at the table that the hostess showed to them.<br />
"Enjoy your meal," said the hostess, smiling.<br />
"Thanks," replied Littletato, smiling.<br />
The hostess went to the counter, a waiter appeared there.<br />
"Can I get you two something to drink?" asked the waiter.<br />
"Yes, please, I want a juice of artificial oranges," replied Littletato.<br />
"For me too, please," said Júlia.<br />
"I'll be right back with your drinks," said the waiter.<br />
"Okay, thanks," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
Then they waited for a little, fiddling with their phones.<br />
After some minutes, the waiter arrived, he placed the jar of artificial orange juice on the table.<br />
He also placed the two glasses in front of Littletato and Júlia respectively, he filled the two cups with juice.<br />
"Are you two ready to order?" asked the waiter.<br />

"Sure," said the waiter, who wrote the order down on his notebook.<br />
Then he went to the counter, after waiting for some minutes, he came back with the meals of the couple.<br />

"Can I get you two anything else?" asked the waiter.<br />
"No, thanks," replied Littletato, smiling.<br />

"Hey honey, let's go home?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes hon, let's pass by the clothes store that Layla works to say goodbye to her," said Júlia.<br />
"Okay honey, hehe," replied Littletato, smiling.<br />
Then Littletato started driving there, she programmed the GPS to go to the clothes store.<br />
After driving for a while, they arrived there, the couple got out of the car, walking inside the clothes store.<br />
There was a woman at the cashier of the clothes store, "Hello, is Layla here? We're her friends," asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, I'm gonna call her, what is your name?" asked the woman.<br />
"Littletato," replied Littletato.<br />
Then the woman walked to the deposit, the clothes store did not have any customers at that time, so Layla could talk a little.<br />
Layla appeared there, saying hi, Littletato said hi back, they got outside.<br />
"So, we're gonna go back home," said Littletato, "And we wanted to say goodbye to you," continued her.<br />
"Oh, where do you guys live?" asked Layla.<br />
"In San Francisco, hehe," replied Júlia.<br />
"Oh, okay then," said Layla, "Goodbye guys, we talk on Vegebook, okay?" asked Layla, who gave a hug to Littletato and Júlia.<br />
"Okay, hehe, goodbye Layla," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Goodbye Layla," said Júlia, smiling too.<br />
Then Littletato and Júlia walked to the car, they entered it and Littletato turned it on, Littletato drove out of the parking lot, she and Júlia waved their hands while looking at Layla.<br />
After that, Littletato programmed the GPS to go back to San Francisco, it was two PM.<br />
She started driving there, looking at the scenery and the highway, eating and drinking water when they needed.<br />
<br />

"I think it is a good idea hon, hehe, do you want female or male?" asked Júlia, smiling.<br />
"I think I want female hon, hehe," replied Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey, hehe," said Júlia.<br />
Then they slept in the cold night, hugging tight.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 26/05/2019.<br />
I finished revising this chapter on 08/04/2021.<br />
<br />
It was very good to write it, the continuation of Littletato's trip to Texas.<br />
It was good to plan the route, open up a map website to check which cities existed between San Francisco and Texas.<br />
And I didn't know that Texas was a state and not a city.<br />
I always thought that it was a city.<br />
It was good to write about Littletato and Júlia buying clothes and electronics.<br />
And about them eating in the restaurant, I searched on the Internet for how a waiter speaks in restaurants.<br />
I also searched for American restaurant menus to see what they serve, it was good to write that Littletato and Júlia ate all of those delicious artificial meats.<br />
It was good to write about Littletato and Júlia meeting Layla and adding her to their Vegebooks.)

		It was the day twenty-four of June of 2019, a Friday, Littletato lived in San Francisco, she was lying in bed.<br />
Júlia was lying beside her, Littletato was thinking about adopting a dog.<br />
She wanted a female dog, she was awake, Júlia was not.<br />
Littletato grabbed her phone, opened DuckDuckGo, the search engine that she uses, and searched for how to adopt a dog.<br />
The girl read some articles on the Internet about how to adopt a dog, she learned a lot about the subject.<br />
It was six AM, Littletato got out of the bed, walked to the bathroom, and did her morning needs.<br />
After that, Littletato walked to the kitchen, she prepared breakfast and ate, she left Júlia's breakfast there on the table.<br />
Littletato walked to the living room, she saw a light-blue ball floating some centimeters above the ground, it looked like an energy ball.<br />
She touched the ball, and then everything was gone, she looked around and there was nothing.<br />
The floor in which she stepped was white and had her shadow, and the background of that place was white too.<br />
It looked like that place was infinite, Littletato could walk around it and she would not find an end for it.<br />
Then, she woke up, that was a dream, a very weird dream, then, Littletato got out of bed, she sighed and walked to the kitchen.<br />
She looked at the table, Júlia's breakfast was there, exactly how she left on that dream, she thought that was weird.<br />
After that, Littletato walked to the living room, there was no light-blue ball of energy on the carpet.<br />
Littletato walked to the front door, she opened it and walked outside, her house was floating in space.<br />
She wondered why she could breathe there, if there is no air there, there was another house close to Littletato's, and there was a road to get to there.<br />
The girl walked to the house, she entered inside it, there was a couple watching movies in the living room while sitting on the couch.<br />
Littletato could know that the name of the girl was Monika and that the name of the boy was Ted.<br />
Their house looked like a squared spaceship, it had white walls, a blue bathroom-box-like thing on the corner of the living room, the LST letters were written on it.<br />
After that, Littletato walked to their kitchen, Ted and Monika could not see Littletato.<br />
Littletato opened their fridge, it had the TPF letters written on it, she saw a piece of cake there, a packet of Doritos and one can of Coca-cola.<br />
Then, Littletato woke up again, she sat on the bed, it was five and a half AM.<br />
She started walking to the kitchen, "If I see the breakfast again, I swear I'll..." said her.<br />
Littletato did not saw Júlia's breakfast on the table, she sighed in relief.<br />
<br />
The girl walked to the bathroom, she did her morning needs, took a bath, brushed her teeth, and combed her hair.<br />
After that, she walked to the kitchen, Littletato did breakfast for her and Júlia, she walked to the bedroom.<br />
Littletato saw Júlia's phone charging on the wall socket, she woke up Júlia.<br />
Júlia walked to the bathroom and started doing her morning needs, Littletato walked outside to make sure she was not in a dream.<br />
Then she walked inside again, locking the door, she walked to the kitchen and sat at the table.<br />
After that, Júlia finished doing her morning needs, she walked to the kitchen and sat at the table to eat breakfast.<br />
The couple ate breakfast while talking a little.<br />
"Hey honey, I had a really weird dream last night," said Littletato.<br />
"Oh, what happened on that dream hon?" asked Júlia.<br />
Then Littletato explained to Júlia what happened in her dream, Júlia thought that it was weird.<br />
She also had another dream, one about a dog with yellow fur sitting on her lap.<br />
"Also, I read about how to adopt a dog on the Internet, I learned a lot.<br />
And I'm gonna start preparing the house to adopt the dog next month, okay?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay hon, hehe," said Júlia.<br />
They finished eating breakfast, Littletato prepared herself to go to work, Júlia gave goodbye to her, it was six AM.<br />
Littletato started walking to work, she arrived there and sat at her table, she started fixing errors on an app.<br />
Mia helped her fix the errors, she was having a hard time fixing a specific error.<br />
<br />
Júlia stretched a little, she drank some sips of her bottle of water and stored it in the fridge again, it was six and a half AM.<br />
Then she walked to the computer room, turning Littletato's computer on, she walked to the bedroom.<br />
She grabbed her phone that was charging on the wall socket, removing the charger.<br />
Júlia opened the gallery app on her phone and looked at some pictures of her and Littletato.<br />
The girl remembered the trip to Texas that she and Littletato made some months ago.<br />
She remembered that her sister Vitória sent her the image of the logo that she made for that compostable dishware company.<br />
Júlia smiled while looking at the pictures, the picture of the New Year's Eve of 2019.<br />
After that, Júlia walked to the computer room, she locked the screen of her phone and left it on top of the table.<br />
She sat at the chair of Littletato's computer, putting on the on-ear wireless headphones that Littletato bought on the trip to Texas.<br />
Júlia thought about Layla, the girl that she and Littletato met in Texas, she is a very good friend, Júlia talks with her sometimes on Vegebook.<br />
Then, Júlia logged in to her Windows account on Littletato's computer, she opened the Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare to play the Warzone mode of it.<br />
She played some matches of it, she was very good and had made many kills, it was seven AM.<br />
Júlia was a little tired of playing, she stretched a little and closed the game, she also closed the GamePlayer.py Python script.<br />
It was a Python script that Littletato made to count how much time she spent playing a game.<br />
Júlia played COD: MW on Warzone mode for one hour, she put a song to play on Vegecloud and got up.<br />
She walked to the kitchen to drink water, listening to the song on the wireless headphones.<br />
It was so good to be able to listen to music from far away without having to be on the computer.<br />
She drank some sips of her water bottle, then she stored it in the fridge again.<br />
<br />
Júlia wanted to go out for a walk, she needed to stretch her body a little.<br />
She turned the computer off and left the wireless headphone charge on its stand.<br />
After that, Júlia changed herself, she grabbed her phone, her wireless earbuds, and her bottle of water.<br />
Júlia got out of the house, locked the front door, and turned left, starting to walk to the park of San Francisco.<br />
Then, the girl put her wireless earbuds on, she put a song to play on Vegetify on her phone.<br />
She continued walking to the park, listening to the country songs that were playing on the playlist that she put to play.<br />
After walking for some time, Júlia arrived at the park, she was a little tired and sat on a bench to rest.<br />
Júlia rested while looking at nature and listening to the calm songs on her playlist, it was eight and thirty AM.<br />
Littletato sent a message to her on Vegesapp asking how she was.<br />
Júlia replied saying that she was good, and that she has gone for a walk, that she is at the park right now.<br />
Littletato replied saying that it was cool, she said that she finished making the front end of an app, Júlia said that it was cool.<br />
Then Júlia locked the screen of her phone, she got up and started walking back home again.<br />
She arrived there, unlocked the door, and entered the house.<br />
Júlia drank some sips of her bottle of water and stored it in the fridge, she left her phone charging.<br />
It was nine AM, Júlia locked the front door of the house, she took a bath.<br />

<br />
Júlia paid for the ride and got out of the taxi, saying thanks.<br />

Then, she walked back to hall number three, her supervisor was there.<br />
He asked her to grab the new artificial meats and chicken from the deposit, and place them on the refrigerators on hall number four, close to the soda refrigerators.<br />

"I missed you so much Lisa, hehe," said Júlia, caressing Lisa's fur, Lisa licked her face, Júlia smiled.<br />
Then Júlia left Lisa on the floor, she locked the door of the laundry place and walked to the bathroom to take a bath.<br />
Littletato was in her car, driving back home, she passed by the supermarket to buy some stuff.<br />
She bought two bottles of Coca-cola and some Doritos, then she walked back to the car, driving home again.<br />
<br />
After some minutes of driving, Littletato arrived home, she got out of the car and unlocked the front door.<br />
Littletato grabbed the bags of the supermarket and walked inside the house, placing the bags on top of the kitchen table.<br />
She heard the shower, and noticed that Júlia was taking a bath, Littletato walked out of the house and locked the car.<br />
Then she walked back inside again, locking the front door, she stored the two bottles of Coca-cola on the fridge.<br />
Júlia got out of the bathroom, she has finished her bath, "Oh, you're here, hon, I'll start doing dinner while you take a bath okay?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Okay honey, hehe, but first, I gotta say hello to this cuteness," said Littletato, walking to the laundry place and opening the door.<br />
"Hehe," said Júlia, smiling while looking at Littletato, Littletato grabbed Lisa on her torso and caressed her fur, smiling.<br />
After that, Littletato left Lisa on the floor, she locked the door and walked to the bathroom.<br />
Littletato started taking her bath, Júlia started making dinner.<br />
Then, after some minutes, they both finished doing their things, Littletato got out of the bathroom.<br />
Júlia sat at the table to eat, Littletato did that too, they began eating dinner.<br />
"How was your day at work hon?" asked Júlia.<br />
"It was very good hon, I talked with Mia there, I told her that we adopted a dog.<br />
She asked me to send a picture of Lisa to her, hehe," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Oh, hehe, why don't you take one right now then? After we finish eating," asked Júlia.<br />
"Okay hon, hehe," replied Littletato.<br />
"How was your day at work?" asked Littletato, emphasizing the "your".<br />
"It was very good, hehe, I helped an old woman to find the hygiene aisle. and stocked up some shelves, hehe," replied Júlia, smiling.<br />
"That's good hon, hehe," said Littletato, smiling too.<br />
Then they finished eating, Littletato and Júlia washed the dishes together, they walked to the living room.<br />
Littletato turned the TV on and changed to the Vegeflix app to watch a series.<br />
The couple watched some episodes of the SpaceLiving series, a series that showed how the teens of the SpaceLiving Network lived there.<br />
It showed the life of the teens that were residents of the SpaceLiving Network, a network of spaceships that hovered in space.<br />
Littletato and Júlia thought that it was a very interesting series, they wanted to live on one spaceship of those.<br />
After that, the couple was a little tired, they watched two episodes of that series, Littletato turned the TV off.<br />
They both brushed their teeth, Júlia walked to the bedroom and laid in the bed, Littletato walked to the laundry place to check if Lisa had food and water.<br />
Littletato then walked to the bedroom, she laid on the bed with Júlia, hugging her tight, they began sleeping.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 02/07/2019.<br />
I finished revising this chapter on 22/04/2021.<br />
<br />
Then the ending of the "No ekisaitinguna seikatsu Littletato [Littletatoのエキサイティングな生活]" (The exciting life of Littletato) anime plays.<br />
I loved to revise this chapter, I loved writing about Littletato adopting the dog, and her name being Lisa.<br />
Maybe that's a reference to a chapter of The Life of Littletato 7w7.<br />
Or a reference to another story of mine, I don't know, hehe 7w7 (smirk).<br />
I read a lot about adopting a dog on the Internet to write this chapter.<br />
And I liked to write about Mia and Littletato's conversation.<br />
I think I've never written Mia talking inside quotes and stuff.<br />
Hehe, I liked writing about Júlia and Littletato caressing Lisa and giving her love, missing her. :3<br />
I also liked writing about Littletato and Júlia watching that series on Vegeflix, the SpaceLiving Network series.<br />
Maybe SpaceLiving is another story of mine, I don't know, hehe.<br />
<br />
Old notes of the author, written on 02/07/2019:<br />
(This is not how I see Littletato, how I see her is being shown on the website picture and the chapter covers)<br />
Well, it was cool to write this chapter, I changed the title.<br />
I inserted a title instead of doing just "chapter 1" and 2 and 3.<br />
This way I can remember easily what happened in the chapter instead of saying just "the dreamland chapter" or "the Texas trip chapter".<br />
I wrote this piece listening to SubCarbon Records Soundcloud profile, and... I just wanted to say that to you guys. :3<br />
Also, this is how I imagine Littletato (ignore the dogs), a really shy girl. xD)<br />

<br />
It was a Friday, in the year 2020, Littletato slept with Júlia.<br />
After some time, it was midnight on Saturday, Littletato was sleeping along with Júlia, she was laying in bed.<br />
She was having a weird dream, a dream about her getting teleported to a spaceship called LonelyShip.<br />
It had a super fast and powerful computer, it was white, a PlayVegestation 4 gaming console, a bed, and a wardrobe.<br />
The spaceship had white walls inside and out, the computer of the spaceship had a modified version of Windows 10 installed on it.<br />
It was called Windows 10 (SpaceLiving Edition).<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_salmon border_radius_6_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/LonelyShip Story Cover.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
The bed had a blue blanket, the bed was made of some resistant plastic that was light gray, and the wardrobe was gray too.<br />
It also had a Laser Turret outside of it, it could shoot a laser beam to hit approaching asteroids.<br />
The Laser Turret had two modes, the Expanded Range mode, and the Shielded mode.<br />
The Expanded Range mode made it possible for the Laser Turret to shoot asteroids that were in a place that was hard to aim.<br />
The Shielded mode made it possible for the Laser Turret to cover itself with a shield to protect it from asteroids.<br />
Two tall windows to see the sun, the moon, and the Earth, an ergonomic chair with casters, adjustable armrests, height, and back.<br />
The spaceship had also a bathroom, and sixteen turbines to move the spaceship when needed, they were deactivated by default.<br />
The LonelyShip could compress the bathroom to a small place.<br />
Making it possible to the resident of the LonelyShip to open the door of the bathroom and enter inside it, without making the spaceship too large.<br />
The bathroom existed in a type of space that did not occupy physical space, it was the width of the door.<br />
It had a teleporter that could teleport the resident of the spaceship between other spaceships and also to the Earth.<br />
The teleporter was called LonelyShip Teleporter, the initials were LST and were written on the upper part of its plastic frame, the LST was blue.<br />
That teleporter did not exist in older versions of the LonelyShip.<br />
The wardrobe had four doors and was on the right of the LST teleporter.<br />
There was also a fridge that could create any food you thought of, it was called the Thought-Powered Fridge or TPF, the TPF was blue.<br />
It was on the left of the computer chair, and at the right of the left window.<br />
The fridge made foods and drinks that were only nutrients, for example, a slice of pizza.<br />
That slice of pizza would have the smell, taste, and texture of a pizza, but would be just nutrients and vitamins that the resident needed.<br />
The TPF fridge would analyze the body of the resident and make a diet containing the nutrients and vitamins that the resident needs.<br />
Then it would split those nutrients that were needed for the whole day into three meals, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br />
If the resident wanted to eat more than three meals, the fourth and next meals would be only mass, not nutrients.<br />
Foods created by the TPF fridge did not have meat or animal products, they were vegan-friendly.<br />
Particles on the food could change the nutrients that are in it, but could not change the taste, smell, or texture, that was pre-built into the food.<br />
Littletato could know that the spaceship or LonelyShip had an Artificial Intelligence, an AI, that could help the residents of the spaceships manage their spaceships.<br />
The AI was called LonelyShip Artificial Intelligence, or LSAI for short.<br />
The LonelyShip also had four small signboards on its walls, two displaying "SpaceLiving", and another two displaying "LonelyShip" on the right of the SpaceLiving one.<br />
The SpaceLiving and LonelyShip signboards were equal on each side of the LonelyShip, one SpaceLiving one on each side, and one LonelyShip one on each side.<br />
The signboards on the left side were on the left of the window, and the right ones were on the right of the window.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_salmon border_radius_6_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/LonelyShip Story Cover Front Signboards.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
Also, the LonelyShip has two big signboards on the front side of it, one with "SpaceLiving" written on it, and another one with "LonelyShip".<br />
The SpaceLiving signboard is above the LonelyShip one.<br />
<br />
That spaceship, the LonelyShip, was part of a network of SpaceShips, the network was called the "SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network".<br />
A lot of other people lived inside the other spaceships, but Littletato did not know about that, the spaceships were not close enough for you to see one outside your window.<br />
The company that created those spaceships and the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network was called Think Outside The Box or TOTB for short.<br />
It created that spaceship network for teens that were depressed and sad about their lives, they did not have a will or a purpose to live for.<br />
The company teleported the depressed teens to the LonelyShips by teleporting them while they were sleeping.<br />
They were teleported to their LonelyShips, and they thought that it was a dream, then, the LSAI told them that they were not in a dream.<br />
After that, the teens asked if they could go back to Earth, the LSAI told them that they could go back.<br />
The computers of the LonelyShips also had the SpaceLiving Network app or program installed by default, for those who did not like to manage their LonelyShip with an AI.<br />
The residents of the SpaceLiving Network were called LonelyShippers or LonelySpaceShippers.<br />
They also asked what they could do there, and the LSAI explained what they could do there.<br />
If you live in a LonelyShip, you can ask the LSAI for anything, like changing wall colors, or removing and adding furniture.<br />
The Things Generator, a spectral machine or system that exists inside the LonelyShip, will create those things for you.<br />
It can also delete things that you do not want with its powerful laser beam.<br />
Some of the teens decided to stay there, and live a better life in the SpaceLiving Network, they thought they would have fun there.<br />
Using the computer, playing games, listening to music, watching anime, cartoons, series, movies, and videos.<br />
Some of them thought that it was bad to have to eat food, drink water, and sleep, they still needed to do that, but now they could do it easier.<br />
The TOTB company thought that they would live a better life on their spaceships.<br />
Littletato was dreaming about that spaceship, but it felt like she was there like she was teleported to that spaceship, everything was so real.<br />
She even felt like she was floating in bed while smiling before the dream started.<br />
The girl felt like some kind of light surrounded her while she felt that she was floating, she could know that the light was blue by feeling the light.<br />
<br />
Littletato woke up on the bed of the spaceship called LonelyShip, it had white walls, she could see everything that was inside it.<br />
She could see the two windows on each side of the spaceship, one on the left and one on the right.<br />
The girl could see the LST or LonelyShip Teleporter by her left, on the corner of the LonelyShip.<br />
Littletato could see the TPF or Thought-Powered Fridge, a wide desk for the computer, the chair, and the wardrobe.<br />
She got up and asked herself out loud, "Why am I here?"<br />
"You're here because we're taking a test in teens, to see if they would fit the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network.<br />
And we teleported you here while you were dreaming because that's the best time to teleport someone to a spaceship.<br />
Don't worry, it's still night where you live, which is San Francisco, right?" asked the voice.<br />
"Also, sorry for not presenting myself, my name is Claudia, but you can change my name on the settings of the LonelyShip.<br />
I am an Artificial Intelligence, the LonelyShip Artificial Intelligence, or LSAI for short.<br />
I can help you manage the LonelyShip and do other things too," explained Claudia, the LSAI.<br />
"Hmm, her name is Claudia, how weird, the mother of Sasha from The Life of Bigbeet is also called Claudia..." Littletato thought to herself.<br />
"Oh, okay, I know about those things, TOTB, the things on the LonelyShip, and about who you are.<br />
And yes, I do live in San Francisco," replied Littletato.<br />
"So you just want to see if I would fit in here and would like to live here right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, exactly, we, TOTB, teleport teens to LonelyShips to live on them because they are sad and miserable, they are not happy with their lives.<br />
So we teleport them to a place where they can be happy, and do not need money to be happy or to survive," explained Claudia, the LSAI.<br />
"Okay, I'm gonna give this spaceship a try then," said Littletato, "Can you change your name to John?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, now I'm called John," said John, the LSAI, "Why do you want me to have that name?" asked him.<br />
"It's the name of my father, to remind me of him," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, okay," said John, the LSAI.<br />
<br />
Then, Littletato got out of the bed, she was looking at the speakers of the computer, the computer was off and the computer screen was black.<br />
She walked to the window, she could see the Earth and the moon, she walked to the other window on the right of the bed, she could see the sun.<br />
Littletato walked to the TPF fridge, she thought of a can of Coca-cola, then she opened the fridge, there was a can of Coca-cola there, and nothing else.<br />
The girl opened the can of Coca-cola, making a gas noise, she looked at the computer speakers while holding the can.<br />
"So, just to make sure, I can leave this spaceship right?" asked Littletato to John.<br />
"Yeah, you can, just enter the LST teleporter and select your address on the LST menu," explained John, the LSAI.<br />
"Okay..." said Littletato.<br />
"If you still have questions, you can contact a SpaceLiving Volunteer Helper on the official Discord server of the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
Do you want me to turn the computer on?" asked John.<br />
"Yes, please," replied Littletato.<br />
John turned the computer on, it booted up.<br />
Littletato saw the home screen of Windows 10 (SpaceLiving Version).<br />
The Discord program was open, she was asked to log into her Discord account to use it, she already had one.<br />
Littletato typed her email and password, pressing enter, she came across her normal Discord.<br />
But she received a Discord server invite from a user called Think Outside The Box, the company that created the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
A Discord server is like a group where you can spend time, you can create channels for different categories or topics of messages and posts.<br />
She clicked on it and entered the server, after that, John helped her find the chat room that listed the Volunteer Helpers of the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
Littletato chose a helper with the user name Lisa, she opened the direct message (DM) screen with Lisa to write her a message.<br />
"Hello, I am Littletato, a new LonelyShipper of the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
The LSAI explained the things to me, about the network and the LonelyShips.<br />
It said that I could add new things to my LonelyShip, and those things would appear from the inside of a wall.<br />
But I didn't understand that right, can you explain it to me, please?" asked Littletato in her message.<br />
"Oh, hello Littletato, I'm Lisa, a Volunteer Helper of the SpaceLiving Discord Server.<br />
Can you open your SpaceLiving App on your computer?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Yes, I'll find it, and also, my dog is named Lisa too xD," replied Littletato, who clicked on the SpaceLiving App icon on the start menu of Windows 10.<br />
"I opened it," said Littletato.<br />
"Your dog is named Lisa too? Hehe, xD.<br />
Okay, now click on the LonelyShip - LS tab at the left, then click on the Manage Things button," explained Lisa in a message.<br />
"Right, I'm now seeing the Add, Edit, and Remove buttons.<br />
I clicked on the Add button and four categories appeared, Furniture, Items, Electronics, and Living," said Littletato.<br />
"Yes, you can add, edit, and remove furniture, items like blankets, clothes, electronics like your computer, screen, mouse, video game consoles.<br />
You can't edit living things though xD, you can adopt a pet on the add button, clicking on it, and selecting the Living option," said Lisa.<br />
"Oh, okay, thanks, hehe," said Littletato.<br />
"No problem, tell me if you need more help ^^," said Lisa.<br />
<br />
Lisa thought about something, she opened the direct message of Ted with her, she saw that he was playing the Call of Duty Warzone game.<br />
"Hey, onii-chan, did mom and dad told you how our sisters were? Or how they looked like," asked Lisa in her message to Ted, her brother.<br />
Ted just finished his match of the FPS game, he pressed Alt and Tab to change windows, then he read Lisa's message on Discord.<br />
"Hmm... I think dad told me about it, he said that one had brown hair and the other one had blond hair," replied Ted.<br />
"Oh, thanks nii-chan, hmm... What if... One of them is here in the network?" asked Lisa.<br />
"What? Do you think one of them is here?" asked Ted, surprised.<br />
"Yeah... I think it is Littletato, from the Discord server, check her profile out," said Lisa.<br />
"Oh, okay..." said Ted, who searched for Littletato on the Discord of the SpaceLiving Network, he checked her profile.<br />
"But... How you gonna make sure that it is her?" asked Ted.<br />
"Well... I'm gonna ask her parents' names.<br />
If they are the same as ours, then it is her, also, I already talked with her.<br />
She asked me for help in adding new things to the LonelyShip," replied Lisa.<br />
"Oh, okay nee-chan, tell me if it is her after her reply," said Ted.<br />
"Okay nii-chan," said Lisa.<br />
Then Lisa opened the direct message of her with Littletato, "Hey... Um... Can I ask you a personal question?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Um... Yes," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, okay, can I know the name of your parents?..." asked Lisa.<br />
"Yes... They're called John and Ana, what's the name of your parents?" asked Littletato.<br />
"They have the same name as your parents... Are you Littletato, one of my sisters that I forgot about?" asked Lisa, surprised.<br />
"Oh... Hmm... I think so, my dad told me about one brother and one sister that I had, the sister had gray hair.<br />
He said that they disappeared at a young age.<br />
Can you send me a picture of you, please?" asked Littletato, a little shocked.<br />
"Hmm... I have gray hair... I think I'm that sister of yours then, do you know the name of your brother?<br />
Here is me," said Lisa.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_salmon border_radius_6_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/Lisa.jpg"" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
"I think it started with T, Tad, or something... I can't quite remember.<br />
And also, you look like my sister... Or what I remember of her... Here is me," replied Littletato.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_salmon border_radius_6_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/The Life of Littletato/Chapters/26/Images/Littletato.jpg" style="max-width: 60%;" /><br /><br />
"Oh, okay, it is Ted, and he has brown hair, do you want to meet us?<br />
Like, teleport to my LonelyShip, and then we teleport to Ted's?" asked Lisa.<br />
"And also, I think I remember my sister too, and she was a little like you... With brown hair," said Lisa.<br />
"Yes, that's a great idea, can we go to the house of my parents after that?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes," replied Lisa.<br />
<br />
Then Lisa opened the direct message of her with Ted, it was three AM.<br />
"Hey, nii-chan, Littletato is our sister, she has brown hair, her parents are also called John and Ana.<br />
And she said she had a sister with gray hair, I never mentioned my hair color to her.<br />
I want her to teleport to my LonelyShip, so we can go to yours, is it okay for you?" asked Lisa to Ted.<br />
"Oh, it's okay nee-chan, that's weird... But I'm happy that I'll be able to see my sister again, and apologize to her," replied Ted.<br />
Then Lisa switched to Littletato's direct message, she told her how to send a teleport request to Lisa.<br />
Littletato walked to her LST teleporter, she entered inside it and closed its door, typing the LonelyShip code of Lisa's spaceship on the screen.<br />
After some seconds, Littletato was in Lisa's LonelyShip, "Hey... Sis..." said Lisa, who got up and looked at Littletato.<br />
Lisa walked to Littletato, hugging her, closing her eyes, Littletato hugged Lisa back, closing her eyes, "Hmm... Little sister..." said Littletato.<br />
"Your touch... Your smell... Your voice... I know it, it brings me back memories from my childhood..." said Lisa, feeling Littletato's hug.<br />
"Me too, sis... I'm seeing memories from my childhood, I played with you a lot... you were so cute back then, and is still cute," said Littletato.<br />
"The blurry memories from back then, when there were two people along with my sister and me.<br />
These two other people were blank and blurry, I couldn't remember their faces, voices, or how they looked like.<br />
But now I see that one of them was you, Lisa, my sister, who had gray hair... My mind is filling that blank space with you," explained Littletato.<br />
"Me too... I'm remembering how you were back then, we played a lot together in the dirt," said Lisa.<br />
"What is your age right now, sis?" asked Lisa.<br />
"I have twenty, what's yours?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I have seventeen, where do you live now, sis?" asked Lisa.<br />
"I live in San Francisco, California," replied Littletato.<br />
Then they broke from the hug, Lisa and Littletato looked at each other.<br />
"I'm happy to see you again, sister," said Littletato.<br />
"Me too, sis, I'm sorry if I disappeared suddenly when you and I were little," said Lisa, a little sad.<br />
"Oh, it's okay sis, speaking of that, why did you disappear? What happened?" asked Littletato, curious.<br />
<br />

It was morning on a Saturday, nine AM.<br />
Júlia was worried about Littletato, she was searching for her in the house and outside too.<br />
After her trip to a LonelyShip of the <br />

 Network, Littletato arrived home safely, she was on the bed.<br />
Júlia walked to the bedroom and saw Littletato on the bed, she was very worried, she walked close to the bed and sat on it, hugging Littletato tight.<br />
"Oh honey, I was so worried, I woke up and you just disappeared, I didn't know where you were," said Júlia, sad.<br />
Littletato explained everything to her, she told her not to be worried, telling her that she was safe right now.<br />
She said that she was teleported to a spaceship called LonelyShip, which exists on the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
"I also found my forgotten brother and sister, Ted and Lisa, the ones I told you about some months after we started dating," said Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that's cool honey, I'm glad you found them, how do they look like?" asked Júlia.<br />
Then Littletato grabbed her phone, she opened the Discord app on it.<br />
All of her direct messages that she opened on the LonelyShip were there.<br />
She opened the direct message of hers with Lisa, then she clicked on the photo that Lisa sent her, of Lisa and Ted together.<br />
"So those are your siblings, Lisa and Ted?" asked Júlia, looking at the picture.<br />
"Yeah, they are," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, it should have been a unique experience for you, honey," said Júlia.<br />
"Yes, it was, I reunited with my forgotten brother and sister, I also met my brother's girlfriend.<br />
And I had breakfast with my forgotten siblings, Carol, and my parents, John and Ana.<br />
I used an automatic fridge that created food that you thought about, called the TPF fridge or a Thought-Powered fridge.<br />
The LonelyShip had an Artificial Intelligence that helped you manage the spaceship and modify its things, the LonelyShip had a powerful computer," explained Littletato to Júlia.<br />
"That's wonderful to hear honey, hehe, I'm happy for you, let's make breakfast hon?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Okay honey," replied Littletato.<br />
<br />
Júlia brew some coffee for Littletato, Littletato made some slices of bread with butter.<br />
Then Júlia made a cappuccino for them to drink, the couple had breakfast together, it was delicious.<br />
Júlia was happy to have Littletato back, Littletato explained more things about her trip to the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
The couple gave food to Lisa, Littletato was stroking Lisa's fur while she ate the food.<br />
Littletato thought about Lisa, her sister, who lives on the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
She had a good time there, using the computer, reuniting with her brother and her sister.<br />
Eating with her family all together and united.<br />
Littletato wished to make another trip to her LonelyShip, to talk with Lisa.<br />
Júlia told Littletato that she wanted to live inside a LonelyShip with her.<br />
Littletato said that they could receive a LovelyShip, which was a type of LonelyShip that was made for couples.<br />
Then Littletato grabbed her phone, she opened the Discord app and sent a message to Lisa, to see if she could contact Lisa even if she was not in her LonelyShip.<br />
The message was sent to Lisa, and she replied.<br />
Littletato was sitting on the couch of the living room, Júlia was washing the dishes.<br />
"Hey sis, are you inside your LonelyShip right now?<br />
The breakfast at dad's house was very good, right? I loved seeing the family reunited again," said Lisa.<br />
"No, I teleported back to my LonelyShip after we said bye to dad, mom, and Carol.<br />
Then I laid at my bed, and I began to sleep, I began to float again, and after I woke up, I noticed that I was laying on the bed of my house in San Francisco," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, really? That's weird...<br />
I never heard about a LonelyShipper getting teleported back to its Earth house without wanting to," said Lisa.<br />
"I have a girlfriend, you know, her name is Júlia, I think I already showed you a picture of her, right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, you did, what about it?" asked Lisa.<br />
"So, she was very worried when I came back to here, she asked where I was, I was sad seeing her like that," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, maybe the LonelyShip knew that someone was worried about you at that time and teleported you back to where you were," said Lisa.<br />
"That's a good theory, the LonelyShip knows a lot about feelings.<br />
So, how you doing right now?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I'm good, I woke up some minutes ago, I already took a bath, drank some water, and ate, I'm just checking the notifications of Wattpad.<br />
After that I'm gonna continue to write chapter twelve of The Oddities of Nature, what about you?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Well, I and Júlia just had breakfast, and I don't know what we're gonna do, we're gonna decide xD," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, okay sis, hehe, I'm gonna close Discord to go write a little, tell Júlia that I said hi," said Lisa.<br />
"Okay, hehe, I'll tell her, laters sis," said Littletato.<br />
"Laters :D," said Lisa.<br />
<br />
"Hey honey, I was talking with Lisa on Discord, she said hi to you," said Littletato to Júlia.<br />
"Oh, tell her I said hi too, hehe," replied Júlia from the kitchen, it was ten AM.<br />
"Okay honey, also, I'm gonna take a bath right now okay?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Oh, okay hon, after I finish the dishes, I'm gonna play a little on the Vbox One," replied Júlia.<br />
Then Littletato left her phone charging on the wall socket of the bedroom, she prepared her things to take a bath.<br />
The girl walked inside the bathroom and started to take her bath.<br />
Júlia finished washing the dishes, she stored them on the kitchen cabinet.<br />
She walked to the living room and turned the Vbox One on, grabbing its controller.<br />
Júlia opened the Titanfall 2 game to play, she started playing an online match on it.<br />
After some minutes, Littletato finished her bath, she got out of the bathroom and walked to the bedroom.<br />
Littletato wore some comfortable clothes, walking to the kitchen.<br />
"I'm gonna read some stories on Wattpad okay hon?" asked Littletato to Júlia.<br />
"Oh, okay hon, hehe, if you discover a new story, send me the link of it through Vegesapp," replied Júlia.<br />
"Okay, hehe," said Littletato, who grabbed her water bottle from the fridge, she walked to the computer room.<br />
Littletato turned the computer on, logged on to her Windows account, and opened Mozilla Firefox.<br />
She opened the Wattpad/Veggepad website, a new story appeared on her home page.<br />
It was called "The Life of Littletato", she found that weird, why she was in a story on the Internet?<br />
The author was called "Stake2", she started reading the first chapter of that story.<br />
It had a picture of a girl with brown hair that looked like her on the story cover.<br />
She read the first chapter and thought about writing a comment to the writer.<br />
"Hey... It looks like I'm in this story, that's weird...<br />
Are you stalking me or something?<br />
I feel observed like there's a lot of cameras in my house right now...<br />
How did you write this and why?" asked Littletato in her comment to Stake2.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Stake2 replied to her comment on the first chapter.<br />
"Hey... I'm your creator Littletato, my name is Izaque.<br />
I created your world in... 05/08/2017 I think.<br />
I created an account here in Wattpad and I created a story just to test the website.<br />
I thought about 'potato' and it became you and your world.<br />
'The Life of Littletato', the story has a website too.<br />
You live in a different universe than mine, I am not the Izaque of the SpaceLiving universe.<br />
I'm the Izaque of the Earth universe, the Normal Earth Izaque.<br />
I loved to create you, Littletato - Pequenata, you're my daughter, and I love you... &lt;3 :3," replied Stake2 in his comment.<br />
<br />
Littletato drank some sips of her water bottle.<br />
She saw the notification on Wattpad telling her that Stake2 replied to her comment.<br />
The girl clicked on the notification and started reading the comment.<br />
"Hey, Izaque... So you're my creator, right?<br />
Now I see you as a father... My reality was created by you... That's weird...<br />
I guess I'm happy because of that, thanks for creating me Izaque.<br />
Thanks for giving life to my life, and creating my universe.<br />
You could have done bad things to me, or written some horror or tragic story.<br />
But you decided to make me happy, to give Júlia and Lisa to me.<br />
That experience in the SpaceLiving Network was awesome.<br />
Thank you, Izaque, my creator, father, my daddy, for creating my universe and my reality, I love you so much! &lt;3 :3.<br />
Can I have your Discord please?" asked Littletato in a comment to Izaque.<br />
Littletato felt happy knowing that her universe was created by Izaque, it was eleven AM.<br />
She started reading another story, reading chapter ten of The Life of Bigbeet, by stane2.<br />
After some minutes of reading, Littletato finished reading the chapter, she gave it a vote and commented on it.<br />
Littletato received a notification telling her that Stake2 replied to her comment.<br />
<br />
"Hey, Littletato, yes, I'm your creator.<br />
I love you my daughter, my little blossom :3.<br />
I'll send you my Discord name and discriminator on the Inbox of Wattpad," replied Stake2 in his comment on Littletato's comment.<br />
Then Littletato received an Inbox message from Stake2, it was his Discord name and discriminator.<br />
Littletato added Izaque on Discord, she opened Discord in a new tab of Mozilla Firefox.<br />
"Hey, daddy, I'm so happy that I found my story on Wattpad, the story you created, hehe :3," said Littletato.<br />
"I'm happy that I started writing your story, and that I created your universe.<br />
I always believed that everything that we humans create, exists in another universe.<br />
Every anime, cartoon, series, movie, or story, exists in another universe.<br />
And I'm happy that I can talk with you right now," replied Izaque in a message.<br />
"So... Can I call you Daddy?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Of course, hehe, can I call you baby?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Yes, hehe, hey... Daddy, why do you created me?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I created you to test Wattpad, and I created an account there because I wanted to write too.<br />
I read a Brazilian story that was a science fiction story, it made me feel feelings about it, and I wanted to do that too, to my readers.<br />
I liked to create your story in 2017, it helped me start in writing, and it gave me confidence.<br />
Since I created you, I began to write more and more, to get better at writing, translating, and revising.<br />
And I revised all of the twenty-seven chapters of your story, I even made a crossover with SpaceLiving," replied Izaque in his message.<br />
"Oh, hehe, thanks for telling me that, you're very good at writing daddy, I'm happy that I helped you write and get better at writing.<br />
I'm happy that you made it possible for me to find my brother and my sister, Ted and Lisa, I was so happy at that moment.<br />
When I ate with my family, with John, Ana, Carol, Lisa, Ted, hmm... Thank you, daddy, for writing that," said Littletato, she was very happy, talking with her father.<br />
"No problem baby, hehe, I love to write your story," said Izaque.<br />
<br />
"Hey, can I ask you to give me something, daddy?" asked Littletato, it was mid-day.<br />
"Yes, anything you want, baby," replied Izaque.<br />
"Hmm... I want to live in a mansion with all of my friends, Júlia's sister, and my sister," said Littletato.<br />
"Oh, I guess Júlia already talked about that, right?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Yes, she did, can you give me a better rank at my job?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, I can, who do you want to live with?" asked Izaque.<br />
"I want to live with Iam, Carol, Vitória, Júlia of course, hehe, and I want the mansion to be a trusted house in Lisa's and Ted's LonelyShip.<br />
So they can come to the mansion to eat with us, to do stuff together, play games, hang out," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, okay baby, I'll give you that, it would be awesome to write that, hehe, what about Mia?" asked Izaque.<br />
"I think I don't know her very well to call her to live with me," replied Littletato.<br />
"Okay baby, I'll write the progression to that on the next chapters of The Life of Littletato, after chapter twenty-seven.<br />
Anyway, I'm revising a chapter of your story here, and I'm almost finishing it, it has one hundred forty-four lines.<br />
Today is also a Saturday for me, hehe, what a coincidence.<br />
I'm gonna leave to have some lunch in a few minutes, so, laters baby, I love you :3," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, okay daddy, thanks for writing the journey to the mansion, hehe.<br />
Good lunch, I love you too, daddy, laters :3," replied Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato closed the Discord tab of the Mozilla Firefox.<br />
She drank more of her water bottle, which had 2 liters, then she walked to the kitchen and stored the water bottle on the fridge.<br />
Littletato walked to the computer room again, she turned her computer off.<br />
Then she walked to the living room, she sat beside Júlia, who was playing Don't Starve Hamlet on the Vbox One.<br />
"Hey, honey, let's make lunch? I'm a little hungry," asked Littletato.<br />
"Oh, yeah, hehe," said Júlia, looking at Littletato, giving a kiss on her lips.<br />
Júlia paused the game and save it, she opened the games menu of the Vbox One and closed the game.<br />
Then she held the Vbox Live button on the controller, turning the video game off.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Júlia got up, they walked to the kitchen.<br />
Júlia grabbed the rice from the kitchen cabinet.<br />
She put a pan with vegetable oil on the oven to heat.<br />
Júlia added the salt, rice, and water, simmering it for two minutes.<br />
She left it heating without a lid, letting it boil.<br />
When the water started to boil, Júlia lowered the fire.<br />
Littletato grabbed some artificial vegetables from the drawer of the fridge.<br />
She began to cut them, making an artificial salad.<br />
Júlia had to leave the rice in the oven for twenty minutes for the water to evaporate.<br />
After making the salad, Littletato got some artificial meat from the fridge.<br />
Littletato cut and seasoned the artificial meat with salt, pepper, and garlic, making some beef slices.<br />
Then she put some oil in a frying pan, putting it in the oven for the oil to heat.<br />
She began frying the two artificial beef slices, it looked delicious.<br />
After some minutes, everything was ready, the rice, the artificial salad, and the fried artificial beef.<br />
Littletato and Júlia began to eat lunch together, it was really delicious.<br />
Júlia said that Littletato did a good job on the artificial beef.<br />
Littletato told Júlia about what happened, about Izaque being the creator of them.<br />
Júlia found that weird and was a little shocked, but she understood it.<br />
She wanted to talk with Izaque after lunch, to know more about that.<br />
<br />
(I loved revising this chapter.<br />
I wrote it on 03/05/2021.<br />
And finished revising it on 12/06/2021, a Saturday.<br />
I spent so much time translating the revised chapters of The Life of Littletato and SpaceLiving.<br />
That I forgot how to write in English and how to revise xD.<br />
But it was very good to revise this chapter, I revised it while listening to the Yuru Camp soundtrack.<br />
I love to write stories while listening to that soundtrack, it makes me calm.<br />
And makes me think about all of the past times that I spent writing stories while listening to that soundtrack.<br />
Today is Saturday, I've been trying to sleep early recently, and I think I'm being pretty successful at that.<br />
I've been getting up early, and having more happiness, having more disposition to do things.<br />
Anyway, right now in Brazil is mid-day, I have gotta eat lunch.<br />
Thank you for reading this chapter, thank you, hehe.<br />
Goodbye, or should I say, laters :D.)

(The beautiful Life of Littletato, with much love, Izaque.)<br />
Littletato was dreaming about being a unicorn in the land of Equestria.<br />
She was a purple pony who likes to read books, study things and make science.<br />
That unicorn has five friends, one yellow, another blue, the other one was pink, another one was white, the last one was orange.<br />
She loved all of her friends, and she liked to be with them, they always helped her when she needed it the most.<br />
One of her friends was called Fluttershy, she had a yellow coat and a light pink mane.<br />
Another one was called Rainbow Dash, she had a blue coat and a rainbow mane.<br />
There was another one that had pink skin, she was called Pinkie Pie and had a darker pink mane.<br />
Another one had a white coat and a purple mane, she was called Rarity.<br />
The last friend was called Applejack, she had an orange coat and a yellow mane.<br />
That unicorn that Littletato was knew how to do spells with her horn.<br />
She had a friend called Spike, who was her dragon helper, he could send messages to the princess and ruler of Equestria, her name is Celestia.<br />
Twilight Sparkle was the name of the unicorn that Littletato was in that dream.<br />
She was in her Crystal Castle or Castle of Friendship, she was an alicorn at that point, a mixture of a unicorn and a pegasus.<br />
A unicorn is a pony that has magic inside of them and can make spells with its horn.<br />
A pegasus is a pony who also has magic inside of them and can use that magic to fly with wings.<br />
Twilight Sparkle had both wings and a horn.<br />
She was in her Crystal Castle, reading a book called "The story of the land of Equestria".<br />
It was about a cartoon about six ponies who were super friends and liked to have fun together, and about some humans on planet Earth who liked to watch that cartoon.<br />
Because that book was the book version of the cartoon that existed on Earth.<br />
It talked about anons or anonymous and humans that watched the show.<br />
One human was called Izaque, he was using his computer to write a story about one potato on the Internet.<br />
That chapter was about a specific cartoon being a dream of the main character of the story.<br />
The name of the story was "tatoLittle", Izaque was so happy writing that, a story that he loves a lot, and a cartoon that he loves a lot (My Little Pony).<br />
Littletato in the body of Twilight Sparkle was reading the story, she thought it was a pretty good one.<br />
She liked the character of Izaque because it reminded her of her creator and father, Izaque.<br />
<br />
Littletato thinks he is having fun there, creating her story, having fun while writing, she is so thankful to him, because he created her and her universe.<br />
He gave life to Littletato, and she loves Izaque, she is so happy because of him, and he is so happy because of her.<br />
Then, Littletato, while being Twilight Sparkle, notices that a portal has opened inside her Crystal Castle, an old friend of her from Earth, Izaque, was inside it.<br />
He had beautiful yellow wings of fire and a yellow hand-grappling hook made of lava fluid.<br />
Izaque steps out of the purple portal and talks with her.<br />
"Hey Twilight, how are you?" he asks.<br />
"I'm good, what about you, Izaque?" she asks.<br />
"Me too, long time no see right?" asks him.<br />
Then Twilight replies, "Yeah, but you're here now, and I'm happy because of that".<br />
He said that he was talking with a friend of his, a friend from a distant place.<br />
Izaque was sat on the blue comfy carpet that Twilight had.<br />
She stopped reading her book to listen to him and looked at him.<br />
"Her name is Littletato... I'm her creator, her father, you know...<br />
I wrote this story in 2017, it was called Littletato too, it was so awesome.<br />
I felt so happy writing it, I felt so incredible, it is still awesome to write that story," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, that's very great to hear Izaque! I'm glad you're having so much fun writing it.<br />
Two thousand and seventeen was a long time ago on Earth, right?<br />
You're inspiring me to write a story Izaque! Hehe, that makes me so happy.<br />
I got inspired seeing that you still write your story to this day and are so dedicated to it," said Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Yeah, it was a very long time ago.<br />
Well... Today right now on Earth it's the year 2019, so it was very long ago.<br />
I'm glad I inspired you to write something Twilight, hehe.<br />
If you need help just tell me okay? I'll be happy to help you write something," said Izaque.<br />
"I would love that, hehe, please teach me, Izaque-sensei (teacher Izaque in English).<br />
So... How did you speak with her? Was it good?" asked Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Yeah, it was pretty good.<br />
Well... I think she saw the Littletato story on Wattpad and sent a comment saying that she was in that story.<br />
Then we talked a little through comments on the comment section of the first chapter of my story.<br />
After that, she asked for my Discord name and discriminator, I sent an Inbox message to her with my data.<br />
She added me and we started talking, she thanked me for everything that I did for her.<br />
Even if what I did was just create a story and make good things happen to her.<br />
I'm thankful for meeting her, and I'm happy that I created her story, she is my daughter.<br />
She calls me daddy, and I'm happy because of that..." explained Izaque.<br />
"Oh, that's a pretty good way of meeting someone, meeting them because you wrote a story about them," said Twilight, giggling a little.<br />
"I don't know what Discord is, is it a network that Discord created or something?<br />
How can you two connect that way?<br />
Sometimes I can't understand Discord..." said Twilight.<br />
"Well, Twilight, it isn't the Discord of Equestria, you know.<br />
Discord is only the name of a social network that exists on Earth.<br />
A technology network exists on a website where people can talk with each other and exchange messages.<br />
I also can't understand him, but he's cool and funny, I wanted to be weird and random like him," replied Izaque.<br />
<br />
Littletato in the body of Twilight Sparkle was happy because she was talking with Izaque personally.<br />
Even if she was a pony in Equestria, she loved that moment, she wished that Júlia was there with her.<br />
Suddenly, she was Asuna from Japanese animation or anime called Sword Art Online.<br />
She was fighting by the side of Kirito, which reminded her of Izaque, so courageous.<br />
Silica was there too, a friend of Kirito, Silica reminded Littletato of Júlia, so cute and innocent.<br />
Then she was in the Yuru Camp anime, she was Shimarin or Rin Shima, a camping girl with dark blue hair.<br />
She was sat beside Nadeshiko, a friend of hers, who had pink hair, which reminded her of Júlia, cute and innocent too.<br />
There was also Ena Saitou there, another girl with dark purple hair, which reminded her of Izaque somehow.<br />
She was so happy being there, camping with those girls, it felt calm and relaxing, camping was very fun.<br />
After some seconds, she was in the body of Izaque, it felt weird being him.<br />
He was writing a story called "The Life of Littletato", he was so happy writing that story.<br />
Izaque was also talking with some friends of him on Discord.<br />
He liked to have company while writing, but not focus too much on it.<br />
Littletato thought that it was incredible, feeling all of his feelings, she loved to be in his place.<br />
She wished that she was there with him, sitting beside him, hugging him, and calling him her daddy.<br />
Talking, doing things together, hanging out.<br />
She thought that she was loving him, but no, she only wanted to be his friend and saw him as her father.<br />
Because he is so incredible to her, being so good and gentle, giving Júlia to her, he is everything for her, she loved Júlia and Izaque very much.<br />
Littletato is still dreaming, thinking, imaging, she loves her life.<br />
She loves to be where she is right now, with her friends, Izaque, thinking about all of the things she can do.<br />
Everything that she could do right now, she wants, she wants to live her life so much right now.<br />
With all of her dreams reminding her about what she haves, and something that someone gave to her, which was life, by Izaque.<br />
<br />
Just like me, being happy for having the ability to write stories, to create things, to create art.<br />
To be able to draw pixel art, drawings in Paint Tool SAI, to be able to show my stories to a specific friend of mine.<br />
She makes me more proud of the stories of mine that I am right now, I love to make stories, and she makes that feeling bigger.<br />
That ergonomic gamer chair that I could draw in that pixel art made me so happy, hehe, it was so beautiful.<br />
Littletato is going to have a good night of sleep right now, and good dreams.<br />
Good night for you too, there, reading this story right now, I do not know who you are, but I probably love you, thank you for reading this!<br />
I love you so much, my reader, and if you are a friend of mine on Discord, screenshot this part and send it to me!<br />
This chapter felt like an ending for "The Life of Littletato", what do you think? Should it end in this chapter?<br />
I think we had a long journey, from 2017 to here, four years writing "The Life of Littletato".<br />
Writing, revising, translating, programming the website in PHP, making book covers.<br />
Writing and perfecting the story, making it better.<br />
Gaining readers, losing readers, discovering a recent friend that likes to read stories and liked a lot to read Littletato.<br />
To know that it already has been four years since I write Littletato and that I got a lot better along this journey.<br />
This gives me the strength to continue... Gives me the strength to write more stories, more chapters.<br />
Strength to face and overcome the fear of not being able to create chapter 30 of "The Life of Littletato".<br />
Or not being able to create more chapters of "SpaceLiving".<br />
I can always write and revise, I just need to start and try, I do not need to have fear of not making it.<br />
I already created twenty-nine chapters of Littletato, why I would not be able to create one more?<br />
Tell me if you think "The Life of Littletato" should end here in this chapter.<br />
Thank you for reading, I'm Izaque, living in 2021 while I write this, good night, good dreams, love you, peace! ❤️.<br />
The beautiful Life of Littletato, Episode 28, with much love, Izaque ❤️.)

		It was a Sunday in the year 2020, Littletato woke up at six AM, she did her morning necessities.<br />
Then Júlia woke up, she also did her morning necessities.<br />
Both of them walked to the kitchen, they started to prepare breakfast together.<br />
Júlia and Littletato finished preparing breakfast, they started to eat.<br />
"Hey, honey, I think I have enough money on the bank to buy a house or a mansion, for us to live with our friends," said Júlia to Littletato.<br />
"Oh, really? How much you have honey?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I have two million one hundred thousand stored in my bank account, I've had some investments while also working, hehe," said Júlia, smiling at Littletato.<br />
"That's really great hon! Hehe, with your money and my one million one hundred forty thousand we can buy a mansion and also pay the bills for some months!" said Littletato, happy and excited.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, so let's look for a mansion in San Francisco for us to buy after breakfast?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yes, hehe," replied Littletato.<br />
Then the couple finished eating breakfast, it was very delicious.<br />
After that, Júlia and Littletato washed the dishes together, they walked to the computer room.<br />
Littletato sat on the chair of her computer, she turned it on.<br />
She also grabbed her phone which was charging on the wall socket close to the computer.<br />
Júlia grabbed her phone from the bedroom, which was charging too, it was fully charged.<br />
She sat on the chair of her computer, turning the phone on.<br />
"So, honey, with your money and mine together, we have three million two hundred forty thousand, right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, that's right hon," said Júlia.<br />
Then Littletato began searching for mansions in San Francisco, CA, she found some at the price of one million, and some pricier.<br />
"Hey hon, what do you think about this one that costs one million two hundred thousand?" asked Littletato.<br />
Júlia looked at the computer screen, she saw that the house had six thousand square feet, it had nine bedrooms and seven bathrooms, also four parking spaces.<br />
"It's very good honey, it has enough bedrooms to accommodate all of our friends," replied Júlia.<br />
"Yes, hehe, I want to live with Carol, Vitória, Iam, and also Lisa and Ted," said Littletato.<br />
"Lisa and Ted are going to live with us? I think they have their spaceships to live on, right?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yeah, but I'm gonna ask them to add the mansion as a trusted house on their LonelyShip.<br />
So they can come to our mansion when they wanted, to make parties and stuff, what do you think, hon?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think that's a good idea hon, I would be happy to meet your other two brothers, and also Carol, I only talked with her on Vegesapp," replied Júlia.<br />
"Oh, okay hon, hehe, can you send the money to my bank account?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay hon," replied Júlia, who opened her bank app and transferred the money to Littletato's bank account.<br />
<br />
After that, Littletato created an account on the website where she saw the ad of the mansion of one million two hundred thousand dollars.<br />
She called the seller that was going to sell her the house, they talked for a while, Littletato asked questions about the house, to know if it had any problems.<br />
He said that everything was working properly.<br />
Littletato made the offer of one million two hundred thousand dollars to the seller.<br />
She asked her bank for a proof-of-funds document, proving that she had the money to buy the house.<br />
Littletato included an inspection and appraisal contingency to the offer.<br />
To indicate that she would like to buy the house as long as the home inspection reveals that the house is in good working order.<br />
And the appraisal comes back in the ballpark of the purchase price, the seller accepted Littletato's offer to the house.<br />
Littletato scheduled a home inspection to the house, she and Júlia drove to the house by car.<br />
They arrived there and checked everything in the house, they checked if everything was working right.<br />
After that, they got home again, Littletato made some title research on the house, to make sure there are no unknown liens or claims on the house before she takes ownership.<br />
The house had a clearly defined lot that showed the property boundaries of the house.<br />
She also bought homeowner's insurance, to make sure that her money is insured in case something unexpected happens.<br />
Littletato also asked for an appraisal of the house, to make sure that the house was worth what she was paying for.<br />
The girl planned a wire transfer between her and the owner of the house to transfer her money to the owner.<br />
She paid the association fees, closing costs, and got to the closing table, she signed the paperwork to transfer the house to her name.<br />
Then she transferred the money to the bank account of the old owner of the house.<br />
The owner gave the house keys to Littletato, she and Júlia were there at the house, they were so happy.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_salmon border_radius_6_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/The Life of Littletato/Chapters/29/Images/Mansion of Littletato and Friends.png" style="max-width: 60%;" /><br /><br />
Littletato and Júlia looked at the house, it was so beautiful, so big, they entered the house.<br />
"Hey honey, we gonna be left with one million forty thousand dollars of money left.<br />
And I calculated that we gonna pay seven thousand six hundred eighty of annual property taxes," explained Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that's okay hon, we have the money to pay that annually, right?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," replied Littletato.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato sent a text message to Carol, asking if she wanted to live with her, she said yes, it was seven AM.<br />
After that, Júlia sent a text message to Vitória, asking if she wanted to live with her and Littletato, Vitória said yes.<br />
Littletato and Júlia asked all of their friends if they wanted to live with them, they replied positively.<br />
Then Littletato made a Partnership Agreement.<br />
It is a legal contract entered into when a group of individuals goes in together in a joint venture.<br />
The partnership agreement will dictate how Littletato and her friends will be required to interact when it comes to purchasing and living in the home.<br />
While she and her friends can agree to almost anything, if she fails to address certain issues, state laws (usually called Uniform Partnership Acts) will fill in the blanks for her.<br />
Littletato and her friends will take the title as tenants in common.<br />
As tenants in common, every partner will have an equal right to possess and use the whole property while maintaining the ability to transfer their interest to anyone they want.<br />
She called everyone to the house, Iam, Carol, Vitória, Lisa, Ted, and Monika, they signed the Partnership Agreement.<br />
Littletato told to Iam who everyone was, her sisters, brother, the sister of Júlia, and Monika.<br />
Lisa and Ted added the house as a trusted house to their LonelyShips.<br />
Ted and Lisa hugged Júlia and Vitória, they liked to meet them.<br />
Littletato and the others discussed who would do maintenance, repairs, how the property would be used, who would be allowed besides the owners.<br />
She also discussed with them the house rules and other things.<br />
"I'm so happy right now, owning a house with you guys," said Júlia, smiling while looking at them.<br />
"Me too, hehe, it looks fun," said Lisa.<br />
"So, Carol will mow the lawn, Vitória will take out the trash, Iam will fix broken windows and other broken things of the house.<br />
I and Júlia will take care of paying the bills, fees, and the annual tax, we just need you guys to give a part of your money for us to pay the bills, okay?" asked Littletato.<br />
Then everyone replied positively, "Hey, we have enough space for our cars right?" asked Iam.<br />
"Yes, we have four garage spaces here, one for me and Júlia, one for Carol, Vitória, and you Iam, if we need more space there's always the yard," replied Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato decided what bedroom would be for who.<br />
"So, you guys can move when you're ready, we gonna move today, Vitória can do her job remotely right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah," replied Vitória.<br />
"You too, right sis?" asked Littletato to Carol.<br />
"Yes, hehe," replied Carol.<br />
Then everyone got out of the house, they got their cars to go to their houses to bring their stuff.<br />
Lisa, Ted, and Monika teleported to their LonelyShips, they created some things with the Thing Creator, using the SpaceLiving App.<br />
They made a copy of their powerful computers to bring them to their bedrooms in Littletato's mansion.<br />
Lisa and Ted also asked for a TPF Transformation Device, which was a device that could transform a normal fridge into a TPF fridge.<br />
They both got one and teleported back to Littletato's mansion.<br />
The LonelyShip Teleporter or LST of Lisa was in Lisa's bedroom on the mansion, Ted's and Monika's LSTs were also in their bedroom.<br />
Lisa, Ted, and Monika placed the copies of their computers in their bedrooms.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Júlia drove back home, they hired a local company to move their stuff to the mansion.<br />
After some minutes, they arrived there with a small truck, they started packing the things inside the house, it was eight AM.<br />
Littletato told them to pack the computers, electronic stuff, the video game and television, and the dishware.<br />
Júlia filled up some boxes and bags with their clothes, the movers grabbed the boxes and bags and placed them on the moving truck.<br />
Littletato told the address of the mansion to the movers, they started driving there.<br />
Júlia and Littletato finished getting the other things of the house, they left the built-in furniture, the bed, the couch, and other things.<br />
They placed everything on the front trunk of the car, they also got Lisa's stuff, Júlia would take Lisa, the dog, in her trunk.<br />
Littletato locked the house and entered the car, Júlia was already there on the passenger's seat, holding Lisa.<br />
After that, Littletato began driving to the mansion while listening to a rock song on the car's radio, using her phone on Bluetooth mode.<br />
They were so happy about owning a mansion with their friends.<br />
Júlia was smiling, looking at the road, thinking about the mansion.<br />
After some minutes of driving, Littletato arrived there with the car, she parked it on the road.<br />
Then she got out of the car, Júlia did that too, Littletato locked the car.<br />
Littletato told the movers where to put the boxes and the bags, they placed them in the bedroom of Littletato and Júlia in the mansion.<br />
After that, Littletato paid the movers when they finished their job, it was $150 in total.<br />
Then Littletato opened the front trunk of her car, Júlia left Lisa in the closed yard of the mansion, where there was a pool.<br />
Júlia and Littletato began bringing the boxes and bags that they placed on the car's trunk.<br />
They placed the boxes and bags in their bedroom of the mansion.<br />
Lisa and Ted walked to the big kitchen of the mansion, they looked at each other and the device in their hands.<br />
"Oh, you also thought in transforming the fridge into a TPF fridge, hehe," said Ted, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, I think it would be great, hehe, to eat any food when you want," said Lisa.<br />
Then they both placed the devices on the sides of the two-door fridge, the devices looked like they were electrocuting the fridge.<br />
After some seconds, the devices disappeared and made a booming sound, Lisa opened the fridge thinking about a slice of pizza.<br />
There was a slice of pizza inside the fridge, Lisa looked at Ted and smiled, Ted smiled back.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Júlia walked to the kitchen, it was nine AM.<br />
"Oh, you guys are here, did you two finished bringing the stuff of your LonelyShips to here?" asked Littletato to Ted and Lisa.<br />
"Yeah, we finished, we just made a copy of our computers and brought them to our bedrooms," explained Lisa.<br />
"And also, test your new fridge, sis," said Ted.<br />
"What? But this fridge isn't new..." said Littletato, who walked to the fridge.<br />
"Open it while thinking of some food," said Lisa.<br />
"This can't be what I think it is..." said Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato opened the fridge while thinking of a chocolate cake.<br />
There was a chocolate cake on the fridge, Littletato smiled.<br />
"Oh, this is a TPF fridge, how did you do that?" asked Littletato, smiling.<br />
"We can ask for a device that transforms any fridge into a TPF fridge," said Ted.<br />
"Yeah, we asked for it on the SpaceLiving App on Windows 10," explained Lisa.<br />
"Oh, thank you, hehe," said Littletato, smiling while hugging Lisa and Ted.<br />
Then Littletato and Júlia said bye to Ted and Lisa, they walked to their bedroom to unpack stuff.<br />
They started unpacking the bags and clothes.<br />
Lisa and Ted got back to their bedrooms, they turned their computers on.<br />
Monika was also using her computer, the bedroom of Ted and Monika had space for placing two computers.<br />
Lisa told SpaceLiving Izaque that Littletato had brought a mansion to live in with her friends.<br />
Izaque was very happy knowing that, Lisa also told John about that, he said that it was very cool.<br />
Monika told Sayori, her sister, that she started living in the mansion that her sister-in-law had bought.<br />
Sayori said that she wanted to go to San Francisco to visit her sister, Monika.<br />
Monika asked Littletato if Sayori could go there for a visit, she asked that through Vegesapp/Whatsapp, Littletato said yes.<br />
Littletato and Júlia finished unpacking the things and organizing their clothes on the bedroom cabinets.<br />
Júlia said that she was a little tired, it was nine and thirty AM, Júlia said that she was going to sleep a little, Littletato said okay.<br />
The bedroom of Littletato and Júlia had two keys, one stayed at the door and the other one on a keychain on the wall.<br />
<br />
Littletato pocketed one and got out, locking the door so no one disturbed Júlia while she slept.<br />
Then Littletato walked to the living room, she left her phone charging there on the wall socket, it was ten AM.<br />
She walked to the kitchen, she was a little hungry.<br />
The girl opened the fridge, she grabbed the sandwich on a plate and the cup of chocolate milk.<br />
After that, she sat at the big dining table, she started to eat, it was very delicious.<br />
Lisa appeared there, she sat on the other side of the table, looking at Littletato.<br />
"When are Vitória, Carol, and Iam coming?" asked Lisa, drinking some sips of her water bottle.<br />
"Vitória said that she's going to take a flight back to New York to bring her stuff.<br />
Carol got her car and started driving back to Los Angeles to bring her stuff too, it was one and a half hours ago.<br />
Iam said that he had to buy some things before packing his stuff, I think he's gonna come soon," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, I wanted to talk more to Vitória, I think she is cool," said Lisa, looking at Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, she is very cool, me, Júlia, her, and Iam made a barbecue together on a Sunday, just like this one," said Littletato, looking up at the ceiling, thinking of that day.<br />
"It looks like it was very fun, hehe, I wanted to do a barbecue with you, sis," said Lisa, smiling while looking at Littletato.<br />
"Oh, let's make one with everyone then, what do you think, sis?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think it's a great idea, hehe, I'm gonna go sleep a little, I'm a little tired.<br />
I had fun organizing my stuff, hehe, building my computer, and bringing some clothes," said Lisa, getting up.<br />
"Good lunch, sis," said Lisa, who kissed Littletato's cheek and hugged her.<br />
"Oh, thank you, sis, rest well, I love you," said Littletato, hugging Lisa back and kissing her cheek, smiling.<br />
"Thanks, and I love you too, hehe," said Lisa, smiling, who started walking back to her bedroom, she locked her door and laid on the bed, starting to sleep.<br />
Vitória booked her flight from New York to San Francisco, she prepared her bags to bring on the plane.<br />
Iam finished buying the things he needed to pack his stuff, he got back home and started packing his belongings.<br />
After some minutes, he finished packing them, placed everything in his car, and began driving back to Littletato's Mansion.<br />
Littletato had finished eating her sandwich, she still had half of her chocolate milk left to drink.<br />
She got up and walked to the living room, grabbing her phone, then she got back to the kitchen and sat on the chair.<br />
The girl created a group on Vegesapp/Whatsapp and added every resident of the mansion there.<br />
Júlia, Vitória, Carol, Lisa, Ted, Monika, and Iam.<br />
Littletato had created another group called The Rules of the Mansion, where only moderators could post, she made Júlia a moderator.<br />
She posted the rules of the house there, which bedroom was for who, who did the housework, and other rules.<br />
The other group that she created was called The Mansion of Littletato and Friends.<br />
After everyone was there, Littletato had to take a picture of everyone in the front of the mansion to set it as a picture of the group.<br />
Iam sent a message to the group, "Hey, I liked this group, hehe, thanks for making it Littletato.<br />
I'm gonna check the other group if I forget a rule.<br />
I'm getting there in a minute," said Iam on the message.<br />
<br />
Then, after some minutes of driving, he arrived there and parked his car in the parking space.<br />
He locked his car and unlocked the trunk of it, grabbing his stuff and bringing them to his room.<br />
After that, he locked the trunk of his car and got back to his room, he started organizing his room and his belongings.<br />
Littletato sent a message to the chat group of the mansion.<br />
"Since we have the TPF fridge now, which generates food for us, we don't need to set someone to make food on each day," said Littletato in her message.<br />
"Oh, that's good, now we can eat any food any time, hehe," said Carol in the message.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, when are you gonna arrive here, sis?" asked Littletato.<br />
"In thirty minutes I guess, I'm half of the way to San Francisco," said Carol on the group.<br />
Littletato copied her message talking about the food and the TPF fridge to the rules group, as a notice.<br />
Then she finished drinking her chocolate milk.<br />
She deleted her message talking about the food and the TPF fridge on the rules group.<br />
Littletato made an Announcements group to post the announcements of the mansion, she liked to be organized, only moderators could post there.<br />
She sent the message talking about the food and the TPF fridge there.<br />
The girl also sent a message talking about the Xbox One in the living room.<br />
She said that anyone can play on it, as long as they do not play on the Xbox Live account of another person.<br />
Littletato told them to add their Xbox Live accounts to the Xbox One when they arrive there.<br />
"The kitchen also has a dishwasher, so no one needs to wash dishes, the TPF fridge can also delete dishware, so it's better to use it.<br />
Also, I'll ask everyone to download the lock app, it is an app used to lock and unlock the door of the house.<br />
It was created by a company that creates digital locks for house automation.<br />
Please download the app and send me your IDs in private so I can permit your phones to unlock the house door," said Littletato in a message to the Announcements group.<br />
The girl blocked the screen of her phone and pocketed it, she left her cup on the TPF fridge for it to delete.<br />
After that, she walked to her bedroom, unlocking the door, entering inside it, and locking the door again.<br />
She left her phone charging on the wall socket, besides Júlia's phone, she laid beside Júlia to sleep with her.<br />
<br />
Lisa, Ted, and Monika were also sleeping, they were tired of organizing their clothes and building their computers.<br />
Vitória was on her flight back to San Francisco.<br />
Carol was arriving in San Francisco, she was heading to Littletato's Mansion.<br />
Iam had finished organizing his stuff, he locked the door and laid on his bed.<br />
"Hey, I'm gonna sleep a little, I'm really tired..." said Iam in a message on the chat group.<br />
Carol had arrived at the mansion, she parked her car there, opening the trunk and bringing her stuff to her bedroom.<br />
Vitória arrived in San Francisco, she got a taxi to go to Littletato's Mansion.<br />
She paid for the taxi and got out of it with her luggage, walking inside the house and going to her bedroom.<br />
Carol got out of the house and locked her car, she got inside again and walked to her bedroom, then she started organizing her stuff.<br />
Vitória also started organizing her stuff.<br />
Littletato and Júlia were so happy to be able to live with their friends together in a mansion.<br />
It was a dream that Júlia had since chapter fifteen, I mean, since January of 2019.<br />
And this is a big change in the life of Littletato, Júlia, and all of the other residents of Littletato's Mansion.<br />
Let's see what this new journey will bring.<br />
<br />
(I loved so much to revise this chapter, I didn't revise it, I deleted everything that existed on it, and created a new thing.<br />
I wrote this chapter on 14/02/2020.<br />
This was when I started watching Dr. Stone: Stone Wars: 14/01/2021.<br />
And I finished revising it on 15/06/2021.<br />
<br />
I loved to write this chapter, to write about Littletato's dream of living with her friends coming true.<br />
It was tough to research and search about how to buy a house with cash in the United States.<br />
I spent a lot of time searching for guides and reading guides on the Internet.<br />
It was so awesome to write about Littletato and her friends moving to the new house, the mansion.<br />
Planning the Partnership Agreement, Lisa, Ted, and Monika adding the mansion as a trusted house to their LonelyShips.<br />
Writing about Littletato eating in the big kitchen and Lisa showing up to talk with her.<br />
Lisa and Ted transforming the fridge into a TPF fridge.<br />
Littletato creating three groups about the mansion, the house, was something that I would do if I would live with friends.<br />
Writing about Littletato hiring the movers was cool too, and getting out of the house, Júlia bringing Lisa with her in the car.<br />
Thinking about how the rooms of them look like.<br />
The bedrooms of Ted and Lisa with their LSTs there.<br />
Sayori asking if she could visit Monika in the mansion.<br />
Everyone sleeping because they are tired after they organized their stuff xD.<br />
It was so much fun to write this chapter, I love it, hehe.<br />
I wrote it while listening to the soundtrack of Yuru Camp as always.<br />
Right now is mid-day of 15/06/2021, a Tuesday.<br />
I think I already spent four hours in total on this chapter, writing it, and I loved it.<br />
Thank you so much for reading, hehe ^^.)

		It was a Monday, the first day of January of 2021, it was New Year's Day, Littletato had a great year, and she was ready to start another one.<br />
Littletato was in her bedroom in her mansion, she woke up at eight AM, brushed her teeth, combed her hair, and also washed her face in the bathroom inside her bedroom.<br />
She did not have to work today, today was a federal holiday, she also could take two days off each year.<br />
Littletato thought about everything that she did in 2020.<br />
The girl reunited with her forgotten brother and sister, she also discovered that she is inside a story and that her creator is called Izaque (*wink*).<br />
Littletato dreamed about being the character Twilight Sparkle from the cartoon My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic.<br />
She also had bought a mansion to live in with her friends and invited everyone.<br />
Everyone moved their things to the house and started living there, Carol and Vitória had started working remotely just like they did before, using their computers.<br />
Littletato had put her house for rent, for people to live there, a buyer showed up, he started living on the house, paying the rent and bills.<br />
The girl was downtown with her friends on New Year's Eve, she was with Júlia, Carol, Vitória, Ted, Monika, Lisa, and Iam.<br />
Everyone looked at the big screen with the countdown for the new year, Littletato and Júlia counted down along with the countdown, just like New Year's Eve in 2018.<br />
Littletato and Júlia were happy, spending their New Year's Eve with their friends, they also counted along with Littletato and Júlia.<br />
The girl was sitting on the bed, Júlia woke up, she did her morning necessities, she and Littletato walked to the kitchen.<br />
Littletato thought about a sandwich with artificial ham and cheese, and also a cup of chocolate milk, she sat at the table.<br />
Júlia thought about a hamburger with some artificial salad and some spices, ketchup, and mayonnaise, and also thought about a can of Coca-cola.<br />
She opened the fridge and grabbed the plate with the hamburger and the can of Coca-cola, placing both on the opposite side of where Littletato was sat.<br />
Júlia also grabbed the plate with the sandwich with ham and cheese and the cup of chocolate milk which she assumed being of Littletato.<br />
Littletato and Júlia started eating breakfast, it was very delicious, it was good eating together.<br />
Carol appeared there, she opened the fridge and grabbed her water bottle, it had two liters of capacity and had half of water.<br />
"Oh, hey, good morning guys," said Carol to Littletato and Júlia.<br />
"Good morning," said Júlia and Littletato in unison.<br />
"You guys don't work today right?" asked Carol, who sat at the table, drinking some sips of her water bottle.<br />
"Yeah, it's New Year's Day, we also don't work on the day fifteen of January, the birth of Martin Luther King," said Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that's good, hehe, I also don't work today, so, I'm gonna play some games on my computer.<br />
And maybe hang out with my friends around the city," said Carol, smiling.<br />
"That seems interesting, hehe, we're gonna do a walk in the park," said Júlia.<br />
"That's interesting too, hehe, I'm gonna go back to my bedroom, see you later, guys," said Carol, smiling, getting up.<br />
"See you later sis," said Littletato.<br />
"See you later, Carol," said Júlia.<br />
Then Carol walked back to her bedroom, she brought her water bottle with her, leaving it on the right side of her chair.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Júlia finished eating breakfast, they left the plates, cup, and can inside the TPF fridge.<br />
They both walked to their bedroom, entering inside it and grabbing their phones, which were recharging on the wall sockets.<br />
Júlia and Littletato used an app to register when they ate, so they can know when they could drink water and when they would be hungry.<br />
After that, Littletato walked to the kitchen, she opened the fridge while thinking about dog food, a bag of dog food was there.<br />
Littletato grabbed it and walked to the closed yard, opening the glass door, the automatic dog feeder was empty, but there was some dog food on the bottom of it.<br />
She filled the dog feeder with the dog food, and also refilled the water bowl with water.<br />
Lisa, the dog of Littletato, was there, she jumped on Littletato's knees, Littletato caressed her head.<br />
The sun was hitting the grass, covering all of the yard space, it was beautiful and warm, Littletato closed the glass door and sat on an outdoor chair.<br />
Júlia was inside her bedroom, she grabbed her phone and walked to the closed yard.<br />
She opened the glass door and got outside, closing it, "Hey honey," said her, walking to another outdoor chair and sitting on it.<br />
"Hey, let's go to the park after thirty minutes? When we can drink water or do exercises," asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey," replied Júlia, she put some calm music to play on her phone.<br />
They both stayed there, in peace, listening to the calm music, looking at nature, feeling the warm sun, seeing the trees wave.<br />
Lisa, the dog, was there, she jumped on Júlia's knees, Júlia caressed her fur, then Lisa walked to the automatic dog feeder, drinking some water.<br />
Littletato and Júlia heard some cars pass by, and also some planes, they liked to stay close to nature.<br />
Júlia looked at her phone, thirty minutes already passed, she paused the music.<br />
Littletato and her got up, they walked inside the house, closing the glass door.<br />
Júlia put her phone to charge a little in her bedroom, Littletato and her prepared themselves to go to the park.<br />
Littletato opened the locker app on her phone to check if the front door was locked, it was.<br />
After that, Littletato pocketed her phone, her and Júlia walked to the kitchen, they both grabbed their water bottles inside the TPF fridge.<br />
Júlia walked to the bedroom and grabbed her phone, they both got outside the house, Littletato locked the door with the locker app.<br />
She sent a message in the chat group of the mansion saying that she and Júlia were going for a walk in the park.<br />
Iam replied saying okay, he said that he was in the mall with his friends.<br />
Littletato and Júlia started walking to the park, Littletato pocketed her phone, it was good to feel the sun in the morning, it was eight and a half AM.<br />
<br />
After walking for a little, they arrived at the park, Júlia and Littletato sat on the grass, looking at nature, the trees.<br />
There were some mothers with their children, they left their children playing in the park, playing Frisbee and other games.<br />
Júlia and Littletato laid on the grass, looking at the sky and sun, they turned to look at each other, kissing romantically.<br />
Littletato was caressing Júlia's hair, hugging her with her eyes closed.<br />
"I love you, honey," said Júlia.<br />
"I love you too, hon," said Littletato.<br />
They also drank some sips of their water bottles.<br />
Littletato and Júlia took a picture in the park, close to the trees, they were happy at that moment, some minutes had passed.<br />
After that, they got up, they started walking back to the mansion.<br />
"Hey, honey, what do you think of a milkshake?" asked Júlia.<br />
"That sounds delicious hon, hehe," replied Littletato.<br />
Then they started walking to an ice cream shop that existed close to the park.<br />
Littletato ordered a chocolate milkshake with Ovomaltine, Júlia had ordered a strawberry milkshake.<br />
They sat at the table to wait, after some minutes, their order arrived, they started to drink their milkshakes.<br />
It was very delicious and cold, Littletato took a picture of her milkshake to post on her Vegesapp status.<br />
After that, they finished drinking their milkshakes, Littletato walked to the counter to pay.<br />
It was $1.99 for each shake, being $3.99 in total, after that, Littletato and Júlia started walking back to the mansion.<br />
Then, after walking for some minutes, they arrived home, Littletato opened the front door with the locker app.<br />
Júlia and Littletato entered inside the house, closing the front door.<br />
They both registered how much water they drank using an app on their phones, they stored their water bottles inside the fridge.<br />
Littletato left her phone charging on the wall socket of the bedroom.<br />
"I'm gonna take a bath honey, what do you want to do?" asked Littletato, who was sat on the bed.<br />
"Oh, I want to play a game with you, maybe Overcooked 2, can we bathe together?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Of course honey, hehe," replied Littletato, she got up and locked the door of the bedroom.<br />
Then they prepared themselves to take a bath, entering the bathroom.<br />
The couple started taking a bath together, it was nine AM.<br />
<br />
Iam was driving his car, he was with two friends of his, they already got out of the mall, they were watching a movie at the movie theater.<br />
The boy was driving to the house of their friends, he left them there and said bye to them.<br />
After that, he started driving back to the mansion.<br />
Iam owned the house where he lived before moving to the mansion, he put it to rent to earn some money.<br />
After some minutes of driving, Iam arrived at the mansion, he parked his car inside the garage.<br />
Then he got out of the car, locking it with the car keys and locking the garage door.<br />
He walked inside the mansion and walked to his bedroom, leaving the keys of his car on the keychain.<br />
After that, he started taking a bath, he was a little tired, it was nine and forty AM.<br />
Littletato and Júlia finished their bath, they got out of the bathroom and wore some comfortable clothes.<br />
Then, they walked to the kitchen, Littletato got an apple from the fridge, Júlia picked up her water bottle.<br />
The couple walked to the living room, Littletato grabbed her controller and the controller of Júlia, giving it to her.<br />
She turned the Vbox One on, waiting for it to initialize, then she typed her local password with the controller buttons.<br />
After that, Littletato opened the Overcooked 2 game to play along with Júlia, they started to play.<br />
They had to make some sushi on the game, prepare the dishes to serve the clients which were bread demons.<br />
Iam had finished his bath, he got out of the bathroom inside of his bedroom, wearing some comfortable clothes.<br />
Then, he walked outside his room, walking to the living room, seeing Littletato and Júlia.<br />
"Hey, guys," said Iam, who sat on the couch, looking at the couple.<br />
"Hey," said Littletato and Júlia in unison, looking at Iam.<br />
"Do you guys wanna have lunch together?" asked Iam.<br />
"Yeah, that would be good, let's have it at ten AM?" asked Júlia, looking at Iam.<br />
"Oh, okay, I'm gonna go back to my room to stay at my computer a little, I'll get back here when it's ten AM," said Iam, getting up.<br />
"Okay," said Littletato, smiling at Iam.<br />
Then Iam walked back to his room, turning his computer on and sitting on his chair.<br />
He opened YouTube to watch some videos, he had his water bottle close to him.<br />
Littletato and Júlia continued playing more levels of the game.<br />
<br />
After some time playing and watching, Littletato, Júlia, and Iam stopped doing what they were doing, it was ten AM.<br />
Littletato turned the video game off, Júlia and Littletato walked to the kitchen.<br />
Iam closed the web browser and left his computer downloading some things.<br />
He walked to the living room, did not found Littletato and Júlia, then walked to the kitchen.<br />
"So, what do you want for lunch?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Oh, I'll want some rice, beans, an artificial salad, and some artificial beef," replied Iam.<br />
"Okay, hehe," said Littletato, smiling, who opened the fridge, there were three plates with some warm rice, and beans, and also some artificial salad and artificial beef.<br />
It looked delicious, some smoke was coming out of it, the smoke of heat.<br />
"What for drinking?" asked Júlia, Littletato grabbed the three plates and placed them on top of the table.<br />
"Oh, maybe some Coca-cola? Hehe," replied Iam.<br />
"Sure, hehe," said Júlia, who opened the fridge and grabbed the two-liter bottle of Coca-cola.<br />
She placed the bottle on top of the table, Iam grabbed the three glasses and placed them beside the plates.<br />
Iam then sat on the chair, looking at his plate, Littletato also sat at her chair.<br />
Júlia was standing, she opened the bottle of Coca-cola and served Littletato and Iam, then filled her glass with Coca-cola.<br />
"It's good to serve like this right? Not getting the filled cups from the fridge," said Júlia, smiling, leaving the bottle on the table and sitting.<br />
"Yeah, and it's good to eat with friends, not alone, hehe," said Iam.<br />
"Yes, hehe," said Littletato, they started to eat together, hunger is the best spice, eating with friends is a good one too.<br />
The food was very delicious, Iam liked to eat with his friends.<br />
"So, what did you do today, Iam?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Oh, I watched a movie with my friends at the mall, and also hang out with them around the city.<br />
Then I came back here, talked to you guys, and spent some time watching some YouTube videos," replied Iam.<br />
"That's interesting, hehe, me and Littletato made a walk to the park, and we got milkshakes, hehe," said Júlia.<br />
"Oh, that's good, you sure love to eat, right Júlia?" asked Iam, smiling a little.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," replied Júlia.<br />
Then they finished eating, Littletato, Júlia, and Iam spent their day in the mansion, playing, watching, eating.<br />
And sometimes playing with Lisa, the dog.<br />
Lisa, the human, was in her LonelyShip, playing some games, and also writing a little.<br />
Vitória was visiting her family in New York, Carol was visiting her parents in Los Angeles.<br />
<br />
(I loved to write this chapter, it was very good, hehe, it was good to write about the day that everyone had off.<br />
It was good to write about Littletato and Júlia walking to the park and getting milkshakes.<br />
Talking about the New Year's Eve of Littletato and Júlia.<br />
About Iam watching a movie with his friends and coming back to the mansion.<br />
The bath of the couple, and they playing a little on the Vbox One.<br />
I loved to write about Littletato, Júlia, and Iam having lunch together.<br />
It's sad that when you have a TPF fridge and everyone can eat at any time, people do not always eat together.<br />
But I am happy that they ate together in this chapter.<br />
And also, "Lisa, the human" xD.)

		It was a Monday in July of 2021, Littletato woke up, got out of bed, and did her morning needs in the bathroom of the bedroom.<br />
Littletato walked to the kitchen, it was six AM, Littletato grabbed two cheeseburgers and two cups of chocolate milk.<br />
She placed the plates and cups on the kitchen table, she did not felt bad eating the cheeseburgers because they were not made of meat, they were nutrients.<br />
A pizza slice would be nutrients and a little mass with pizza taste, smell, and texture.<br />
The particles on the food could change the nutrients that are in it, but could not change the taste, smell, or texture, that was pre-built into the food.<br />
Júlia woke up and walked to the bathroom of the bedroom to do her morning needs.<br />
Littletato remembered that she talked with the SpaceLiving version of Izaque yesterday through Discord.<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque said that he was doing a Visual Onomatopoeia video on the Sony Vegas video editing program.<br />
He explained how he did the video, what images were used, and the ideas that he had.<br />
Littletato was so happy to have a father that was so talented and creative, she was proud of him.<br />
The girl thought that it was weird to have a father that is younger than her, she has twenty-one in 2021, and Izaque has nineteen.<br />
She sat at the table, thinking about that, she wished to see Earth Izaque, the Earth version of her father, from another universe.<br />
Then, Júlia finished doing her morning needs, she walked to the kitchen of the mansion.<br />
Júlia sat at the table, they started eating breakfast, the cheeseburger was delicious, the chocolate milk too.<br />
Iam appeared there, he grabbed something to eat and sat at the table to eat with the couple, they said hi to Iam, he said hi back.<br />
"Hey, honey, what you were thinking about? You seemed so lost in your mind, hehe," asked Júlia, giggling a little.<br />
"Oh, I was thinking about the conversation I had with SpaceLiving Izaque yesterday, he said he was doing a Visual Onomatopoeia video.<br />
He explained to me how he did the video and stuff, and I was proud of him, proud to have a creative and talented father.<br />
I thought that I wanted to see my father, Earth Izaque, he lives in another universe, I think I already told you that," replied Littletato.<br />
"You already told me hon, I also wanted to see him, to meet the person that created all of our reality, hehe.<br />
I think we should tell that to Vitória, Lisa, Iam, and the others, right?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Oh, I think that's a great idea hon, they're gonna be crazy, haha," said Littletato, giggling a little.<br />
Iam heard that and made a surprised face (O_O), "What?" asked him.<br />
"Yeah, that's it, our entire reality was created by a boy called Izaque, he wrote a story called The Life of Littletato, and then we're born," replied Júlia.<br />
"Wow, that's a lot to take in, I wanna know more after I get back from work, and I want to read that story.<br />
Send me the link of the story through Whatsapp, I want to read it in my free moments at work," said Iam.<br />
"Okay, I'll send it to you when I arrive at work," said Littletato.<br />
After some minutes, the couple finished eating, Iam too, the couple registered when they ate using apps on their phones.<br />
Littletato walked to the bedroom, she started preparing herself to go to work.<br />
She was ready after some time, the girl said bye to Júlia with a kiss, leaving the mansion and starting driving to work, Júlia closed the front door.<br />
Júlia saw Iam leaving with his car, probably to go to work, he worked from six AM to six PM.<br />
Then, Littletato arrived there, she parked her car inside the garage of her work.<br />
After that, Littletato got out of her car, entered the building, and made her check-in, walking to her table and starting to work.<br />
<br />
Júlia was at home, it was six and thirty AM, she grabbed her water bottle from the TPF fridge in the kitchen.<br />
After that, she walked to the closed yard, saying hi to Lisa, the dog, and sat on the area chair, Júlia had her phone in her pocket.<br />
The girl put to play the soundtrack of the Yuru Camp anime, she left her phone on a small desk.<br />
She waited for the time that she could drink water to come, after some minutes, a notification appeared on her phone, saying that she could drink water.<br />
Júlia started taking some sips out of her water bottle, it was six and forty AM, she checked if Lisa had food and water, she had.<br />
After that, she grabbed her phone and entered the mansion, walking to her bedroom, she had bought a computer recently.<br />
A very good and fast one, just little Littletato's, she also bought a new and better laptop and sold her older one.<br />
She sat on the chair and turned her computer on, leaving her two-liter water bottle on the floor.<br />
The girl also left her phone charging on the wall socket.<br />
One month ago, Júlia had started working on a website called SproutGigs.<br />
People could do virtual jobs like watching a YouTube video, upvoting a post on Reddit, or using a TikTok or Kwai code on their phones.<br />
They would do the jobs and send proofs that they did the job to the employer, the employer would check the proofs and confirm the job, the money would be sent to the profile of the worker.<br />
Workers could withdraw the money when they had at least five dollars on the profile, they could withdrawal to PayPal or other bank accounts.<br />
Everyone could be an employer and post virtual jobs to be made there.<br />
She already got a lot of money from it, she was earning half of her salary on it every month.<br />
Júlia did some small jobs on the website, after that, she closed the web browser.<br />
The girl opened the Python script called GamePlayer.py, it was a Python script that Littletato had made to register how much time she spent playing a game.<br />
She selected The Sims 4 game to play, waiting for it to open and turning on the time counter of GamePlayer.<br />
After playing for some time, it was seven and thirty AM, Júlia thought about going for a walk in the park.<br />
She grabbed her phone and water bottle, turned off the computer, left the bedroom, and closed its door, Littletato had a spare key for the bedroom.<br />
Then Júlia left the house, she closed the front door with the locker app on her phone.<br />
After that, she started walking to the park, looking at the scenery and nature, enjoying the warmth of the sun.<br />
Then, after some minutes of walking, Júlia arrived at the park, she sat there, looking at the sky and the sun, drinking some water.<br />
<br />
Iam was at the grocery store where he works, he was at the cashier, no customers were there, he was bored and free.<br />
The boy grabbed his phone and opened Whatsapp, Littletato had sent a message to him, it was the link to her story on Wattpad.<br />
Iam said thanks to Littletato on a message, he clicked the link, waiting for the page to open.<br />
After that, he began reading the first chapter, the story was called "The Life of Littletato", and was created by a user called Stake2.<br />
The writer explained what was his inspiration and why he started writing that story.<br />
He said that it was his first story and that he created it on 05/08/2017.<br />
Iam continued reading, the chapter talked about the moment when Littletato traveled to San Francisco and met Júlia, the moment when they started dating.<br />
Littletato had told that to Iam in a little party they had some time, Vitória and Carol were there too.<br />
Iam thought that it was incredible, and unbelievable, "How Stake2, or Izaque, could know about the life of Littletato?" wondered Iam.<br />
He created an account on the website, after that, the boy added the story to his reading list and followed Stake2, he voted on the first chapter of the story.<br />
Iam opened Whatsapp to send a message to Littletato.<br />
"Hey, Tato, do you have Izaque added in Whatsapp or Discord?" asked Iam.<br />
"Oh, yeah, he sent me his number through Discord, so I added him on Whatsapp," replied Littletato after some minutes.<br />
"Hmm, okay, it's that I wanted to see him on the camera, you know.<br />
But I can't call him right now, my boss is gonna be mad," said Iam.<br />
"Oh, okay, we can do a video call with him when we arrive at home.<br />
I and Izaque never saw each other in a video call, so, me, Júlia, and you in the video call, what do you think?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think it's good, okay, I'll tell you when I arrive home, good luck on your job!" replied Iam.<br />
"Good luck to you too, thanks, bye! :D," said Littletato in a message, then she told Júlia about the video call.<br />
After that, Iam locked the screen of his phone and stored it in his pocket.<br />
A customer arrived in the store, she walked around it, looking for something to buy.<br />
It was a blond girl, Iam thought that she was very beautiful.<br />
The girl grabbed some hygiene products, after that, she walked to the cashier, placing the products there.<br />
Iam grabbed each one of the products, scanning the bar code of them, the computer made additions to the number on the screen.<br />
The boy continued scanning the bar codes of the products while sometimes looking at the girl, he also placed them on one plastic bag.<br />
"It will be seven forty-nine," said Iam.<br />
"Oh, okay, I'm gonna pay by card," said the girl.<br />
Then Iam grabbed the card machine and placed it on the counter.<br />
The girl inserted her card and typed her password, Iam noticed that the girl had very beautiful hands, she had painted her nails pink.<br />
Then, after some seconds, the girl removed her card, the purchase was completed.<br />
She grabbed the bags, Iam said thanks, the girl said thanks back, she walked out of the store, it was eight and forty AM.<br />
<br />
Júlia was already home, she was laying on the bed of her bedroom.<br />
Some hours passed, it was nine and fifty AM, Júlia prepared herself to go to work.<br />
After that, she got a bus to go to work, she arrived there, at the Safeway supermarket.<br />
Júlia started working, organizing some shelves, and stocking them.<br />
After some hours of working, it was six PM, Littletato, Júlia, and Iam finished their jobs.<br />
Iam got his car to go back to the mansion, Littletato too, Júlia got a bus to go back home.<br />
They arrived there, they walked to their bedrooms, Littletato and Júlia started taking a bath together, Iam too, in the bathroom of his bedroom.<br />
After that, they walked to the kitchen to eat something, Littletato suggested for them to eat some pizza with Coca-cola.<br />
Then Iam grabbed the pizza that was inside the TPF fridge, Littletato grabbed the Coca-cola bottle and three cups.<br />
She filled the cups with Coca-cola, Iam placed the pizza box on top of the table, the trio sat at the table to eat, it was delicious.<br />
As they were eating in a group, the slices of pizza would morph to have the nutrients that the person that picked it up needed.<br />
If Littletato would grab a slice of pizza, it would morph to have the nutrients that she needed, if Júlia wanted that one, it would morph to have the nutrients that Júlia needed.<br />
After some time, they finished eating, Littletato and Júlia registered the time when they ate using an app on their phones as always.<br />
The trio walked to the living room, they sat on the couch, Littletato unlocked the screen of her phone and opened Whatsapp.<br />
She searched for the contact of Izaque, calling him, after some seconds, he answered the call.<br />
"Heey, my dear," said Izaque in the video call.<br />
"Hey, daddy, I wanted to talk with you, hehe," said Littletato.<br />
"Oh, me too, we never talked in a video call right? Who you got there with you?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, it's good to see you on camera, I got Iam," replied Littletato, who turned the camera to face Iam, "And Júlia," said her, who turned the camera to face Júlia.<br />
Iam and Júlia said hi to Izaque, looking at him.<br />
<br />
"Aww, it's so good to see your faces moving, hehe, I'm so happy," said Izaque, looking like he was going to happy cry.<br />
"Oh, don't cry daddy, I love you," said Littletato, looking sad at Izaque.<br />
"I love you too my dear," said Izaque, beginning to smile a little.<br />
"So, you created our reality right?" asked Iam.<br />
"Yeah, I did, I think I explained that on the first chapter of The Life of Littletato," replied Izaque.<br />
"Oh, I understand, I was shocked when I knew that you created our reality.<br />
This morning, Littletato and Júlia were talking about you, they looked like they didn't notice that I was there, haha.<br />
And they said that you created our entire reality," said Iam, giggling a little.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, I was so proud of creating you guys and writing that story, hehe.<br />
And that I made it possible for Littletato and Carol to reunite with their forgotten brothers," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, I have a great life, and I'm happy with it, so, thanks, Izaque," said Iam to him.<br />
"No problem, Iam," said Izaque.<br />
"So, what are you doing right now, Izaque?" asked Júlia, Littletato turned the phone to face Júlia.<br />
"I'm just talking with you guys, laying at my bed, hehe, I was programming in Python a little," replied Izaque.<br />
"Oh, so you created the Watch and GamePlayer Python scripts right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, they are very useful to me," replied Izaque.<br />
"Hehe, you're very talented daddy, those scripts are genius," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Thanks, baby," said Izaque, smiling.<br />
"We're gonna do something else right now, okay daddy?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay baby, lateers," replied Izaque, waving his hand.<br />
"Lateers," said Littletato, Júlia, and Iam, then Littletato clicked on the end call button, it was six and thirty PM.<br />
"So, are you happy to meet your creator?" asked Littletato, looking at Iam.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, I'm happy to know where I came from and stuff, maybe I can ask him for things?<br />
Like, thinking about what I want, and then he'll listen to my thoughts?" asked Iam.<br />
"Oh, I don't think he knows how to read minds, Iam, you should try to ask him what you want, talking with him through Whatsapp, I'll send you his contact.<br />
Maybe he has some sort of inter-dimensional connector that connects his Internet with the Internet of other dimensions or universes.<br />
Maybe he can send messages to fictional universes like stories, anime, and cartoons.<br />
Or maybe I'm thinking too much, hehe," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
(Well, in reality, it is something just like that, Littletato, oops, sharing private information, hehe, closing connection\\\\ *bzzt*.)<br />
"Oh, maybe it's something like that, anyway, I'm gonna go play something in my room, okay?<br />
See you later guys," said Iam.<br />
"See you later," said Littletato and Júlia in unison.<br />
After that, Littletato sent the contact of Izaque to Iam through Whatsapp, she turned the Xbox One on, grabbing her controller and Júlia's.<br />
They began to play a game together, it was six and forty PM.<br />
The couple spent their day playing, eating, and drinking water when they need, Iam spent his day in his room.<br />
He played a lot of games, and also checked some news on YouTube and Twitter.

		It was a Saturday, morning, in August of 2021, Littletato woke up, it was six AM.<br />

Iam also woke up, did his morning necessities, and took a bath in the bathroom, the boy then got out and wore some clothes, he turned his computer on.<br />
The boy opened the Mozilla Firefox browser on his computer, opening the Animes Vision anime website.<br />
He opened the page of the "Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu" anime, it was the second part of the second season.<br />
Iam clicked on the page of the first episode, he put the episode to download, Iam also had the Watch_History.py Python script that Littletato had, she gave it to him.<br />
After that, Iam unlocked the door of his bedroom and got out, closing it, Littletato and Júlia did the same.<br />
Littletato had turned her computer on and left some torrents downloading, they were torrents of some movies that Littletato wanted to download.<br />
The trio walked to the kitchen, they decided to eat together, eat some pizza with Coca-cola, Iam grabbed the pizza box and placed it on the table.<br />
Littletato grabbed the bottle of Coca-cola and placed it on the table too, she grabbed three cups made of glass and filled them with Coca-cola.<br />
After that, the trio sat at the table to eat, the pizza was very delicious, they could feel that it had some very good nutrients for them.<br />
Vitória and Carol had woken up, they did their morning necessities and walked to the kitchen, they saw the trio eating.<br />
The two women opened the TPF fridge, grabbed the two plates with pizza slices and the two cups with Coca-cola, they sat at the table to eat together.<br />
Only them were going to eat those pizza slices, so the slices would not change their nutrients, they were pre-made with the nutrients that Vitória and Carol needed.<br />
They were talking while eating, asking things, and talking about what they are going to do today.<br />
Lisa, Ted, and Monika were waking up on their spaceships, they LonelyShips.<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque too, the quartet did their morning necessities, Lisa and Izaque drank some water, after that, they ate something while listening to a calm and relaxing ambient song mix on YouTube.<br />
Ted and Monika also had a Compact Space Door on their LonelyShips, just like SpaceLiving Izaque.<br />
(The Compact Space Door was a door that could bring someone to a place that was compressed to the width of the door.<br />
Making it possible to the owner of the door to open it and enter inside the place that was after the door, without occupying too much space with the place.<br />
Space after the door was a type of space that did not occupy physical space, it was the width of the door.)<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque had sent his Compact Space place to Ted and Monika, it was a plain terrain with natural grass, flowers, plants, trees, and a natural lake.<br />
His two dogs were there, Nega and Pingo, Nega was a female dog, and Pingo was a male dog, Pingo was the son of Nega.<br />
(The Compact Space does not come with the two dogs, just so you know, during the translation, it hinted at this for me xD.) <br />
Ted and Monika had already eaten, they walked to their natural place, passing by the Compact Space Door.<br />
They had some area chairs there, to relax in the cool wind and to feel the sun.<br />
The place had an opening that had protection for air to not escape, it was an opening for the sun to shine and hit the whole place.<br />
Lisa and Izaque registered when they ate using Python scripts on their computers, they opened their web browsers and started doing their daily things.<br />
Izaque wanted to write something today, for at least thirty minutes, after that, he was going to do something from his to-do list.<br />
Lisa was drawing a little, continuing a drawing of her, after that, she was going to try to produce a song on FL Studio 20, a digital audio workstation.<br />
<br />
The people on the Mansion of Littletato and Friends finished eating, the pizza was delicious, it was seven AM.<br />
Littletato and Júlia registered when they ate, the quintet walked to the living room, they sat on the couch.<br />
Only Littletato, Júlia, and Iam knew that it was Earth Izaque that created The Life of Littletato and gave birth to the life of Iam and the others.<br />
Júlia and Littletato told that to Vitória and Carol, they were shocked.<br />
The two wanted to see Izaque on camera and ask him questions.<br />
Littletato grabbed her phone and opened Whatsapp, she searched for the contact of Izaque and called him.<br />
Izaque answered the call, it was a video call, Vitória and Carol talked with Izaque and asked him questions.<br />
They were happy to talk with him, because they have a great and happy life, and were happy to meet him, their creator.<br />
The two thanked Izaque for creating them and giving so many things and happiness to them.<br />
After some minutes of talking, Littletato and the others said bye to Izaque, he said bye back.<br />
Littletato turned the Xbox One on, she had four controllers for it, they were going to play a game together.<br />
Unfortunately, the coop games only accepted up to four players on the same console.<br />
Júlia chose the Overcooked 2 game to play, Júlia, Vitória, Littletato, and Carol played together, only the girls, Iam just watched.<br />
He was with his phone, Iam was playing some Call of Duty: Mobile on his phone while waiting for his time to play.<br />
Iam looked at the screen sometimes to watch the game, the girls made funny things, and sometimes threw food out of the level of the game.<br />
They had fun, Iam, too, laughing sometimes while watching them play.<br />
After some levels, Iam was going to play, Júlia gave the controller to Iam, the quartet started playing, Júlia said that she was going to check if Lisa had food.<br />
She walked to the closed yard and got outside, walking to the automatic dog feeder of Lisa, she was almost without water and dog food.<br />
Júlia walked inside, the door to the closed yard was in the kitchen, Júlia opened the fridge and grabbed some dog food.<br />
After that, the girl walked to the closed yard, she filled the automatic dog feeder with dog food.<br />
Then she made the same with water, grabbing mineral water from the fridge.<br />
She walked back to the living room, they were still playing, it was fun to watch them play.<br />
Júlia grabbed her phone and started playing a game on it, it was seven and thirty AM.<br />
The girl said that she was going to get some sun on the closed yard, she got up and walked to the closed yard, getting outside and sitting on an area chair.<br />
<br />
Júlia was playing a game about a candy land, you had to build some candy machines to make candy, the name of the game was Candy Factory.<br />
And you had to build pump jacks to extract liquid chocolate from the underground, to make chocolate bars.<br />
You had to hire airplane pilots with specialized airplanes to fly and collect the raw cotton from the skies to make cotton candy, the raw cotton looked like clouds.<br />
The person just had to add sugar, a powder to make it softer, and add food dye to paint it.<br />
The player hired miners to mine sugar gems to make gobstoppers (jawbreakers), they were made on the Candyfacture (candy factory).<br />
You could also make candy canes in the Candyfacture using a different version of the Keller Machine, which automated the process of twisting soft cane into spiral striping and cutting it into precise lengths as candy canes.<br />
Then, you could sell the candies and chocolates that you made to another planet, which loved candy, they ate candy and chocolate every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br />
Júlia was happy to play that game, it was very good, and a little addicting.<br />
She was happy to know that she was able to expand her Candy Factory further, and own more lands that have natural candy resources.<br />
The game also had a Candy Research Center, which discovered new candies to be made using the natural candy resources that the land provided.<br />
The gems, which were used to make gobstoppers and lollipops, the liquid chocolate extracted from the underground was used to made chocolate bars.<br />
Also, the raw cotton clouds were used to make cotton candy.<br />
Júlia could mine ores from caves to make lollipops too, she loved to play that game.<br />
The girl could get liquid white cream from some lakes to heat it and make marshmallows.<br />
She could use honey, sugar, and edible glue to make bubblegum.<br />
Júlia also has to build spaceships and hire pilots to bring the candies to the other planet, the City Planet.<br />
It was very good, she had a lot of spaceships coming and getting out of the big Candy Rocket Launch Complex, it had a lot of LaunchPads.<br />
She also had to hire rocket builders and operators, it was where she used a lot of money, she hired a contractor of spaceship staff to hire the workers for her.<br />
The workers came from the City Planet, which was all a city, they had water generators and good seam machines, they had a great electronics manufacturing speed.<br />
The planet where Júlia build her machines and her factory was the Candy Planet, she owned it all, but there were other Candy Planets, and they also sold candies to the City Planet.<br />
So Júlia had some competition.<br />
Júlia was playing the game on her phone, sitting on an area chair of the closed yard.<br />
The game showed a message to her, "Hey, do you want to teleport to your Candyfacture?" asked the message, Júlia found that message weird.<br />
Júlia was managing the Candy Rocket Launch Complex, which was a little far from her Candyfacture, she clicked on accept because she wanted to go there.<br />
Lisa, the dog, was closed to Júlia, when she clicked accept, a gold portal with a dark center appeared on the physical screen of her phone, it was eight AM.<br />
Júlia and Lisa were sucked by the portal, they entered inside the phone, into the game.<br />
<br />
Júlia was there, inside her Candyfacture, it was all so real, the machines, the smell, the touch, the sounds.<br />
"Have I been teleported to the game?" asked herself, she looked at the ground, "Oh, Lisa, you're here too," said Júlia, grabbing Lisa and putting her on her chest.<br />
She had a phone in her pocket, it was her phone, but it did not have the candy game installed.<br />
Someone called her on the phone, she answered it.<br />
"Hey, boss, we discovered a new recipe for candy, it uses some rare gems from a mine on this planet.<br />
Do you want to try it? You can also hire more miners to mine those rare gems," asked a woman on the phone, she was probably from the Candy Research Center.<br />
"Oh, okay, I'll go there to try," replied Júlia, they said bye to each other.<br />
Then Júlia looked for a specific contact on her contact list, there was a contact called "Miner Manager", she called him and told him to focus on the rare gems and sent him the location of the cave.<br />
The Miner Manager managed the miners and told them where to mine first.<br />
There was also a maid there, she had blond hair and wore a French maid costume.<br />
"Hey, boss, you know that you have a house here right?<br />
If you want, I can bring Lisa there, to stay in the closed yard, my name is Frederica by the way." said the maid.<br />
"Oh, okay, thanks, I'm gonna miss you, Lisa, hehe," said Júlia, caressing Lisa's fur and putting her nose on her, smelling her.<br />
Then Júlia gave Lisa to the maid, she started walking to the house of Júlia, it was not very far, Júlia could see it.<br />
The house was made with candies and stuffed cookies, it also had some whipped cream and melted chocolate.<br />
Júlia noticed that the Candy Land did not have any cars, only planes, and spaceships.<br />
She wanted to buy some good cars from the City Planet to make her workers work faster because they travel faster from where they work to the warehouse.<br />
The miners could travel by car, from the mines and caves to the warehouse to store the ores and gems.<br />
The pump jack operators could bring more liquid chocolate on their cars than by foot.<br />
She discovered that the City Planet ate candies because it was the only thing that they had to eat, their planet did not have soil or animals to make food.<br />
They extinguished all of the animals and soil that existed there, everything was dead, they had highly technological cities.<br />
People there only had candies to eat, and it was healthy for them, so they needed the Candy Planets to feed them.<br />
Júlia had some money left, some millions, she bought fifty cars and also hired a civil engineer to construct roads on the Candy Land.<br />
She also hired a crew of constructors to make houses on a specific part of the planet, away from the Candyfacture.<br />
The girl hired more constructors to build a wall around the whole factory, and build an airport for airplanes.<br />
She was happy to build a lot of things on the game, or the Candy Factory universe, that she could not on the phone game.<br />
Júlia was making a lot of progress, she was happy, and gaining some money.<br />
Her workers, miners, pump jack operators, and honey collectors could make spaceship trips to the City Planet to learn how to drive a car and to get a driver's license.<br />
<br />
Littletato and the others finished playing, they ate something, Littletato walked to the closed yard to search for Júlia.<br />
She did not found her nor Lisa, but she found Júlia's phone on top of an area chair, she grabbed it.<br />
The girl looked at the screen, she saw Júlia inside the game, "Honey, are you there?" asked Littletato, scared.<br />
"Yes, I'm here honey, don't worry," replied Júlia, her voice came from the phone speaker.<br />
"How did you get in there?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Well, the game asked if I wanted to teleport to my Candy Factory, and it was far away from the Candy Rocket Launch Complex, so I accepted.<br />
I thought it was going to teleport my character to the factory, not me.<br />
Then a gold portal appeared on the screen of the phone, Lisa was close to me, we were sucked into the game together," replied Júlia.<br />
"Oh, Lisa is there, where is she?" asked Littletato, getting relieved that Lisa is there.<br />
"She is at my candy house, on the closed yard," replied Júlia, pointing to her house.<br />
"Wow, hehe, I also wanted to go there to eat some candies with you, it sounds delicious, hehe," said Littletato.<br />
Then a gold portal appeared on the physical screen of the phone, it started rotating, just like it did when it sucked Júlia and Lisa to the game.<br />
"No, no, not yet, I still have to tell the others," said Littletato, not wanting to be sucked into the game.<br />
The portal stopped rotating, it then disappeared, "Oh, looks like it understands English, haha," said Littletato.<br />
Then she got up and closed the door, she walked to the trio, Iam, Vitória, and Carol, they were in the living room.<br />
Carol and Vitória were surprised by seeing Júlia on the game, she explained what happened.<br />
"After knowing that Izaque created our reality, nothing surprises me more, hehe," said Iam.<br />
Littletato said that she was going to leave the phone charging and was going to enter inside the game.<br />
She said that to the trio so they do not get worried.<br />
The trio walked to their bedrooms, Littletato too, she locked the door of it and left the phone charging on top of the computer table.<br />
"I want to go there to eat candies with you hon, hehe," said Littletato, smiling while looking at the screen.<br />
The gold portal appeared on the screen and started rotating, after some seconds, Littletato was inside the game.<br />
The couple spent their day on the game, they did not have to drink water or sleep there but could get physically tired.<br />
They could eat the candy and it would be good for them, it would have nutrients.<br />
Littletato helped Júlia manage the Candy Factory and Candy Land, they made some decisions together.<br />
Júlia and Littletato decided to make train lines to bring ores, gems, liquid white cream, and liquid chocolate to the warehouse to make candies.<br />
The couple was happy to eat a lot of candies together, they were eating the candies in the living room of Júlia's house, watching a series on the TV.

		It was a Monday, in September of 2021, Littletato had to work today, she got up at five and a half AM.<br />
Júlia got up too, they did their morning necessities in the bathroom of the bedroom and also took a bath.<br />
The couple walked to the kitchen to eat, they grabbed healthy vegan hamburgers and some natural orange juice without sugar.<br />
They ate and drank, it was very delicious, the orange juice was good without sugar.<br />
After that, they finished eating, the two registered when they ate using apps on their phones.<br />
Then, Littletato started preparing herself to go to work.<br />
Júlia hugged her and kissed her lips, "I love you, hon," said her.<br />
"I love you too, honey," said Littletato, who kissed Júlia's lips back.<br />
Littletato then finished preparing herself, she grabbed the keys of her car in the bedroom and walked to the garage.<br />
She entered the car and turned it on, Júlia said bye to her with a kiss, Littletato said bye back.<br />
The girl got out of the mansion with her car, it was raining a little, with some thunders.<br />
Júlia liked to hear the thunders and the raindrops falling on the roof of the house.<br />
Littletato had closed the door of the garage with the control in her hands.<br />
Then Júlia walked back inside the house, she walked to her bedroom and grabbed her phone which was charging.<br />
She laid on the bed, opened Whatsapp, she texted Izaque, the name of the contact on her phone was Earth Izaque.<br />
"Hey, Izaque, can I also call you daddy?" asked Júlia in her message.<br />
"Of course, Júlia, you're my baby too, hehe :3," replied Izaque.<br />
"Hehe, okay, daddy, thanks for doing that to me, the thing on the Candy Factory game," said Júlia.<br />
"No problem baby, hehe, I like to write about those fantasy stuff, it's cool, like, it's something that is away from reality.<br />
I guess I don't like reality much, the normal stuff, working, eating, sleeping, getting leisure, I don't like to write about that too much," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, I agree, daddy, I don't like that too, the normal stuff, I love living with Tato and the others, but I also like to have some fantasy stuff too, to dream, hehe," said Júlia.<br />
"Hehe, I can always write about you living inside a fantasy if you want, baby," said Izaque.<br />
"I would love that daddy!" said Júlia, with a smiling emoji.<br />
"So, I'm going to write something a little, talk to you later, baby," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, okay, it's it The Life of Littletato? :3" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yeah, hehe *hugs you*," replied Izaque.<br />
"*Hugs back*, okay, baay daddy :3," said Júlia.<br />
"Baay :3," said Izaque.<br />
<br />
Then Júlia locked the screen of her phone, she looked at the ceiling of the bed, it was some kind of cloth, with purple curtains around it.<br />
She got up and walked to the wall socket close to the computer table, leaving her phone there to charge.<br />
The girl turned her computer on, walked to the kitchen, and saw Vitória there.<br />
"Hey, big sis," said Júlia.<br />
"Hey little sis," said Vitória.<br />
Júlia grabbed her water bottle from the fridge.<br />
Vitória was sitting on the kitchen table, eating a sandwich, she had her laptop on top of the table.<br />
"What are you doing, big sis?" asked Júlia, who walked close to Vitória, looking at the screen of the laptop.<br />
"I'm making the new logo and visual identity for a startup company of technology, they offer services like software coding and chipset manufacture," replied Vitória.<br />
"Oh, that sounds interesting, hehe, send me the logo when you finish it, big sis," said Júlia, who hugged Vitória.<br />
"Okay, I'll send it to you, little sis," said Vitória.<br />
Júlia then walked back to the bedroom, she closed the door and sat at the computer chair, it was six and ten AM.<br />
She opened the SproutGigs website to work a little, she almost had ten dollars.<br />
Carol had already eaten breakfast, she was in her room using her computer, she also had a laptop.<br />
The girl was making the diet of a customer of her.<br />
She was using her laptop, she closed it and placed it between her arm and her chest.<br />
Carol walked out of the bedroom and walked to Júlia's room.<br />
The girl knocked on the door, "Hey," said her.<br />
Júlia got up and walked to the door, she opened it.<br />
"Hey, Carol," said Júlia, smiling.<br />
"Hey, I wanted to ask if I could stay with you, I'm feeling a little lonely..." said Carol.<br />
"Oh, of course, come on in," said Júlia.<br />
"Thanks, Júlia," said Carol, who entered inside the bedroom.<br />
"Can I sit at the bed?" asked Carol.<br />
"Yes, hehe, can I close the door?" asked Júlia.<br />
"Yeah," replied Carol, who sat at the bed, she placed the laptop on her lap, opening it.<br />
Then Júlia closed the door, she sat beside Carol, "Do you want a hug?" asked Júlia, looking at Carol.<br />
"Yes, please," replied Carol, leaving the laptop on the side.<br />
Júlia then hugged Carol, smiling, "Thanks, Júlia," said Carol, "No problem, hehe," said Júlia.<br />
Then Júlia got up and walked to the computer, she continued working on the SproutGigs website for some minutes, it was six and thirty AM.<br />
She closed the website, she was using the Mozilla Firefox web browser.<br />
<br />
Júlia opened the Paint Tool SAI program on her computer.<br />
She started drawing something, it was an anime girl, Lisa had taught her how to draw faces, bodies, and how to do the anime drawing style.<br />
"This looks good, Júlia, hehe," said Carol, smiling, Júlia turned the chair to face Carol, "Really?" asked her.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, sorry for like, spying on your computer," replied Carol.<br />
"No, it's okay, hehe, and thanks," said Júlia, smiling.<br />
"No problem, hehe," said Carol, Júlia then rotated the chair back to where it was, she continued making the drawing.<br />
Iam was at the grocery store where he works.<br />
The blond girl that appeared in the store on that Monday in July kept coming to the store to buy things.<br />
The boy was happy to see her every day, they even talked a little sometimes.<br />
Iam felt sad when she did not appear in the store, he was used to seeing her every day.<br />
Vitória came back to her bedroom after she finished eating breakfast, she continued making the logo and finished it, it was seven AM.<br />
Littletato was still at work, programming a little, she was coding a fast-food delivery app for a company called IFood.<br />
Júlia had finished her drawing, she saved it, and closed the drawing program, she still had to post it on DeviantArt.<br />
She said to Carol that she was going to play some "Call of Duty: Warzone" on her computer and that the game had a loud sound, and she was going to use the headphones.<br />
Carol said okay to her, saying that she was going to give her a pat on the back if she needed something, Júlia said okay.<br />
Then Júlia opened the game and selected the Warzone (Battle Royale) mode, she started playing it.<br />
Carol had finished making the diet of her customer, she opened the Grammarly website on her laptop.<br />
The girl started writing an essay about the Vegan lifestyle, and why Veganism is more than a diet.<br />

She was going to post that essay on her blog.<br />

The girl was happy to write that, she sent a draft of the chapter to SpaceLiving Izaque to see what he thought of it, she was writing chapter sixteenth.<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque said that it was very good, she was happy to hear that from her friend.<br />
It was still raining a little in San Francisco, Iam was still at the grocery store, he was reading some chapters of "The Life of Littletato" because there were no customers.<br />
