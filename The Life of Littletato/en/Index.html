		Hello, I am Izaque Sanvezzo, Stake2, and Funkysnipa Cat.<br />
<br />
This is "The Life of Littletato", a story of mine, I created on August 5, 2017 (05/08/2017).<br />
I created it on the "Wattpad" story website, it was one of my first stories.<br />
It came after my first story, "Desert Island", created on October 23, 2016 (23/10/2016).<br />
I created an account on Wattpad and wanted to test the website, and how it would be to write on it, creating a story called "Littletato".<br />
Which was a mix of "Little" and "Potato", then, I began to write it.<br />
I wrote an entire chapter in one line, with grammatical and typographical errors, with few interesting things.<br />
I still have files of the old chapters to read and see how my writing and storytelling skills have improved.<br />
So, in 2021, I started to revise all of the chapters, to make them better.<br />
And write them in the style of my story "SpaceLiving", with topics and transitions separated by paragraphs.<br />
My story "SpaceLiving" was created on January 19, 2019 (19/01/2019).<br />
I got inspired to start writing stories because of a Brazilian story in the green text format, a writing style that originated on the website 4chan.<br />
The story is called "Year 2035", a name given by me, as it is the first sentence of the story.<br />
Created by "Magno A Lima", around 2017, it is a story of science fiction, survival, fighting, zombies, and superpowers.<br />
It tells the story of "Andros", a man who participates in resistance, fighting against a controlling government.<br />
Against zombies, controlling corporations, criminals, and scientific experiments on humans.<br />
The story was so good and interesting, I could feel what the characters were feeling, and imagine the scenes and scenarios.<br />
And I wanted to make people feel and imagine that too, that is why I started writing Littletato.<br />
It has been six years already, six years of writing Littletato, this wonderful story, I am writing from 2023.<br />
It is incredible to see how Littletato has evolved a lot over these six years.<br />
She started as a potato, and a story of a potato in a world of vegetables, like a fable, and a test story.<br />
And she evolved into a girl, a responsible and mature woman, who has her house, work, and a spouse.<br />
She has fun, listens to music, watches things, rides a car, visits places, and goes out with her friends.<br />
I am so happy to know that I already created thirty-three chapters of this story, that makes me so happy :3.<br />
I love this story so much, it helped me create this love and passion for writing and helped me start writing other stories of mine too, like SpaceLiving.<br />
So, thanks for giving my story a try, and I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.<br />
<br />
This story is inspired by:<br />
Slice of life anime, that shows the everyday life of a person.<br />
The anime "Yuru Camp", shows the lives of girls who like to camp as a pastime and their daily lives.<br />
It is a very relaxing anime about camping, and it has a very relaxing soundtrack too, which I always listen to while writing Littletato.<br />
I would say that the soundtrack of Littletato is the soundtrack of Yuru Camp, and also songs from the folk genre.<br />
Littletato would also like to go camping just like the girls of the anime.<br />
She likes to have relaxing moments like this, on a Saturday morning, after having lunch, spending time with her family or friends, sitting on the sofa.<br />
Watching TV, sitting on area chairs, relaxing, in a park having a picnic, or going on a trip.<br />
This story is also inspired by normal daily life, that I have, and that I see in other places.<br />
For example, in various media, anime, cartoons, series, movies, and videos that show the daily lives of people.<br />
With this story, I have the wish to show the daily life of Littletato, what her life is like, and how incredible it is.<br />
I love this story so much, and I'm happy to write it and to have created it.<br />
<br />
Littletato was a girl that lived alone, she was always traveling through cities, looking for a good city to live in.<br />
She loved to travel, experience new things, places, and nature, smell new smells, and hear new sounds.<br />
Littletato was nineteen years old in 2019, and was born on February 4, 2000.<br />
The girl stopped by a city called "San Francisco" and started analyzing, the weather, traffic, and people.<br />
She found another girl while walking in San Francisco, it was afternoon, after mid-day, and a little cold.<br />
Her name was Julia and she was eighteen years old, she was born on Jun 25, 2000.<br />
They were in a cafeteria drinking a decaf coffee, sitting on a table outside the cafeteria.<br />
The weather was cold, with wind, and a cloudy sky.<br />
The two girls were wearing winter clothing, very warm and comfortable.<br />
During the talk, they noticed that they had a lot in common.<br />
Julia also liked to travel, to analyze the weather, people, and scenery of the cities.<br />
"Do you like reading stories?" asked Littletato, who took a sip of her coffee.<br />
"Yes, I love it, what about you Littletato?" asked Julia, looking at her, while holding her coffee mug.<br />
"Me too, it's so good to meet someone that likes the same things as you right?" asked Littletato, happy.<br />
"I agree, hehe," replied Julia, smiling, tucking her hair behind her ear.<br />
"Where do you read stories?" asked Littletato, curious.<br />
"I rent books from the city library, and sometimes I read some digital stories on the Wattpad website," replied Julia.<br />
"Oh, how interesting, me too, I didn't know you used Wattpad too, hehe," said Littletato.<br />
Julia said she lived alone in a rented house in the city.<br />
Littletato said she was going for a walk around town, got up, and paid the bill for Julia.<br />
Then Julia gave her number to Littletato, so they could talk again.<br />
Littletato said that she was a traveler girl and that maybe would not stay in San Francisco, because she was only analyzing the city.<br />
Julia was a little sad about that, she liked Littletato and found her an interesting girl.<br />
The two said goodbye to each other with a hug, then Littletato walked to a bus stop and waited.<br />
<br />
Littletato got a bus and started walking through the city.<br />
She was thinking about Julia, about her eyes, her hair, and her gentle voice.<br />
She listened to the music of the Folk genre on her phone, using earbuds, while looking out the bus window, thinking, and reflecting.<br />
Littletato thought she was in love, just thinking about Julia's voice made her smile.<br />
She was thinking about the city and Julia, while she looked at the city scenery.<br />
The girl got up and pulled the bus rope, it stopped at a bus stop and the girl got off.<br />
She started walking around the city, with her phone, wallet, money, and other useful things inside her backpack.<br />
The girl remembered that she liked to program sometimes, to make computer programs and applications to help her be more efficient and faster.<br />
Littletato created computer programs in her parent's house when she was a kid, she was fascinated by technology when she was younger.<br />
She thought she would like to work on a programming job, and that it would be fun.<br />
Then the girl started looking for programming jobs in San Francisco on the Internet.<br />
She found some vacancies and sent her digital resume to several of them, she knew a lot of job websites.<br />
A company accepted her resume and contacted her to give information about the job interview, place, and time.<br />
Littletato ate a delicious dinner at a restaurant, and spent the night in a hotel, paying for accommodation.<br />
She also took pictures of the city of San Francisco, of her dinner, and of the outside of the restaurant.<br />
The girl liked to take pictures of good moments of her life, to keep as memories.<br />
She sent those photos to a WhatsApp group called "Status", and also posted them on her WhatsApp status.<br />
("WhatsApp" is an app that you can install on your smartphone, it lets you chat with people, but you need a phone number and a SIM card to use it.)<br />
<br />
In the morning, she woke up, did her morning needs, and got a bus to the place of the interview.<br />
It was a company called "Interworks Technologies", she entered the building and someone received her.<br />
Then Littletato went through the interview, answering the questions of the interviewer.<br />
After the interview ended, they said they would further review Littletato's resume and give her an answer later this week.<br />
Some time passed, and it was already night, she came back to the hotel and grabbed her phone, looking at Julia's number, on WhatsApp.<br />
She sent a message to her via VegesApp, saying:<br />
"Hey Julia, it's me, Littletato, I was thinking bout' staying here in San Francisco... It seems to be a good city to live in.<br />
I went through a job interview today, I think I'll get it... I'm very confident in this position."<br />
<br />
Julia replied some minutes later:<br />
"Oh, really?!... I'm so happy because of it :3<br />
Good luck! I hope you get the job Littletato ^^"<br />
"Thanks, Julia, happy because I'm gonna stay? :3" asked Littletato, happy.<br />
"Yes, I think you're cool, and I like you... As a friend...<br />
Do you consider me your friend?" asked Julia, curious.<br />
"Yes Julia, and thanks, I think you're cool too ^^<br />
Can I call you Ju?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Hehe, yes you can, and can I call you Tato?" asked Julia, happy because Littletato would stay in the city.<br />
"Yes you can Ju, hehe," replied Littletato.<br />
"Okay, well, I'm gonna sleep now Tato, good night, sleep tight ^^," said Julia.<br />
"Good night Ju, see you tomorrow :3," said Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato slept on a peaceful night in San Francisco, very comfortable in her bed.<br />
<br />
When she woke up in the morning, noticed that she had received a message on her phone.<br />
She unlocked her screen to check it, it was from the company that had interviewed her, and she was accepted on the job.<br />
In the message, there was more information about the job, hours, salary, holidays, days off, and other important information.<br />
Littletato was so happy, she was smiling a lot, and sent a message to Julia to let her know the news.<br />
"Hey Ju, I got the job, they accepted me! :3" said her.<br />
"Really?! That's really great!<br />
I knew you could do it, congrats Tato!" replied Julia.<br />
"Thanks, hehe," said Littletato.<br />
Littletato started working at the company, making computer programs and applications.<br />
And also helped her co-workers, who were newbies, and were starting at the company.<br />
She started living in a rented house.<br />
<br />
Then, three months passed, and Littletato was already used to her new, stable life, in San Francisco.<br />
Her relationship with Julia continued to grow stronger and stronger, and the two grew closer.<br />
Littletato was in her house, she already worked today, and it was six in the afternoon.<br />
She picked up her phone and opened the WhatsApp app.<br />
Then she started typing a message to Julia, that said:<br />
"Hey Ju, I have something to tell you :3<br />
But can I ask you something first?"<br />
"Yes, what's up Tato? :3" asked Julia.<br />
"Can we meet at that cafeteria where we met for the first time?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay, I'll go prepare myself, when are you going to be there?" asked Julia.<br />
"At six and a half in the afternoon," replied Littletato.<br />
"Okay, I'll be there, hihi," said Julia.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato started to get ready to go to the cafeteria, left her house, and took a bus to go there.<br />
They both got there, sat down, and ordered two decaf coffees, just like the first time they'd met.<br />
"So... What do you want to tell me Tato?" asked Julia, while looking into Littletato's eyes.<br />
"I... I like you, Ju... More than a friend...<br />
You're so gentle with me and helped me a lot.<br />
I think your hair is cute, and your voice too, you're so beautiful..." replied Littletato, a little shy and insecure.<br />
"Hum... Thanks, Tato... I like you too...<br />
I like the fact that I have a lot of things in common with you," said Julia, smiling, blushing, as she looked at Littletato.<br />
Littletato picked up her chair and sat at the side of Julia, she hugged her and said "I love you," Julia said the same.<br />
They looked at each other's lips, their heads started to approach and Littletato gave her a peck.<br />
Littletato and Julia started kissing deeply, hugging tight, feeling happy and in love.<br />
<br />
After some time, Littletato stopped the kiss for shortness of breath.<br />
She looked into Julia's eyes, in love with her, and happy.<br />
Littletato asked if Julia wanted to live with her and share the rent.<br />
Julia said yes, and they moved to the house where Littletato lived.<br />
The house was very good, it had planned furniture and a good bathroom.<br />
Air conditioning, a heater, an electronic garage, and hot water.<br />
Julia did not work, she said that she had some money stored in her bank account, and she paid her old rent without any problems.<br />
Littletato said that she was going to work to pay her part of the rent and gather money to buy the house.<br />
And also do some investments in fixed and variable income, stock exchange, cryptocurrencies, and other investments.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
A few months had passed, and Littletato had worked hard, gathering money in her bank account, as well as making safe investments.<br />
She managed to buy the house of the owner for her and Julia to live, without having to pay rent, only paying the energy and water bills and the house taxes.<br />
Then Littletato and Julia started living there, eating, drinking, cleaning the house, and having fun together.<br />
Julia said she was very happy, living together with Littletato, her girlfriend.<br />
Littletato arrived home from her job, it was afternoon, already getting dark, she entered the house and locked the front door, saying "I'm home love".<br />
Julia was sitting on the couch in the living room, watching a series on Netflix, "Welcome back honey," said she.<br />
Littletato sat by her side and hugged her tight, kissing her lips.<br />
Julia prepared dinner with the help of Littletato, and the two ate while talking a little, after that, they watched something on Netflix for some minutes.<br />
<br />
Then, they went to the bedroom and lay down on the bed, covering themselves with the blanket.<br />
Littletato hugged Julia tightly from behind and kissed her neck, Julia shivered and closed her eyes, feeling sleepy.<br />
"I love you, Tato," said Julia, smiling, and kissed Littletato's hand.<br />
"I love you too, Ju," said Littletato, who sniffed Julia's hair and closed her eyes.<br />
They slept soundly into the night, waiting for tomorrow, for a new day they would spend together.

		Littletato was coming back home, she finished her work and was carrying a bag of food that she brought from the market.<br />
She found a friend of hers, Littletato made that friend while she was traveling through San Francisco, they met on the bus.<br />
Her friend was a sweet potato called Yam, he was a man.<br />
"Hi Yam, good to see you!" said Littletato looking at Yam.<br />
"Good to see you too, Tato," replied Yam while smiling.<br />
They talked for some time.<br />
"Hey Tato, did you know that in Las Vegas they sell meat and vegetable even if there are cows in there?" asked Yam.<br />
"I didn't know, it is very bad," said Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, I agree," replied Yam, while looking a bit sad.<br />
"Well, I gotta go, my sister is in town again, I brought her favorite chocolates.<br />
I gotta go back home, or else she will be angry at me, hehe, see you later Tato," said Yam, who started walking back home, waving goodbye to Littletato.<br />
"Bye, see you later Yam," replied Littletato, waving goodbye back.<br />
<br />
Littletato arrived back home, she talked to Julia about the conversation that she had with Yam.<br />
Julia said that she wanted to meet Yam sometime soon, Littletato said she is going to introduce Yam to her.<br />
Littletato placed the food bag on top of the table and helped Julia prepare the dinner.<br />
They ate dinner together while talking a little.<br />
Julia asked Littletato how her was her job today.<br />
Littletato said that it was pretty cool, she met a new coworker who started working on the company.<br />
Her name was Mia, she was a carrot, Littletato helped her with a problem she had with the program she was making.<br />
Then Julia and Littletato finished eating, they made their necessities, and walked to the bedroom.<br />
The couple lied on the bed and covered themselves with the blanket.<br />
Littletato hugged Julia tight because it was cold, they slept.<br />
<br />
On the other day, Littletato woke up but Julia did not.<br />
She looked at the clock and saw that it was five in the morning.<br />
Littletato got out of bed and walked to the bathroom to make her morning necessities.<br />
After that, she walked to the kitchen and started making breakfast.<br />
She picked up two mugs and poured milk and chocolate powder on them, mixing the chocolate powder and milk, with the help of a spoon.<br />
Then she picked up two plates and placed two slices of bread on each one.<br />
She grabbed a knife and butter, passing butter on all of the slices of bread.<br />
Then she came back to the bedroom and woke up Julia.<br />
Julia walked to the bathroom to do her morning necessities.<br />
<br />
Both walked to the kitchen and ate breakfast together.<br />
"You still have some time before going to work, right honey?" asked Julia.<br />
"Yes, why the question my dear?" asked Littletato.<br />
"It's because I miss you when you go to work, honey," said Julia, looking a little sad.<br />
Littletato sat at the side of Julia and hugged her tight, giving a kiss on her lips.<br />
"It's okay, honey, when I get back home, I'll be all yours okay?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay, hehe, I love you my lil potato," said Julia, looking passionately at Littletato.<br />
Both of them finished eating, Julia thought it was very delicious, Littletato too.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato gave a kiss on the lips of Julia and got up, walking to the living room.<br />
She had a computer in her house, she walked close to it and sat on the chair, turning the computer on.<br />
Julia walked to the bedroom and wore a hoodie, it was a little cold.<br />
Julia had a laptop, she walked to the living room and grabbed it, putting her laptop on the side of Littletato's computer.<br />
She turned it on and started using it, opening the browser to browse the Internet.<br />
After some time using the browser, Julia opened the game Countable Vegetrike 1.6 to play a little.<br />
This game was an FPS or first-person shooter game where you needed to complete an objective.<br />
Littletato looked to her right and noticed Julia there, she smiled, then opened the Vegebook website, and logged in to her account.<br />
(Vegebook is a website where you can talk to a lot of people and can have a profile, a lot of people use it only to talk and keep in contact with their family.)<br />
She looked at the chat, seeing her friends online.<br />
Even if those friends were just digital friends, she was happy to have them.<br />
And she could count on them because they would help her.<br />
Littletato began to roll the page down.<br />
Her friends always posted some news, one news got her attention.<br />
It was news talking about how New York citizens were trying to fight the fruits and wanting freedom.<br />
The news said that the fruits were invading New York and the vegetables did not like that.<br />
Littletato thought that San Francisco was good because of that.<br />
The city of San Francisco was stabilized, with no fight between the citizens.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato closed the page and started rolling her Vegebook feed again.<br />
Her old friend Yam sent a message to her in Vegebook.<br />
She clicked on the message to see what it was.<br />
Yam said that in New York there were good jobs, that it was a good city to live in.<br />
Littletato replied that she already had a job in San Francisco, and had bought a house too.<br />
She also said that she was living with her girlfriend.<br />
Yam said that it was good and that he was happy for Littletato, he wished happiness for the couple.<br />
Littletato sent a smile emoji and said thanks.<br />
"And you Yam, have a girlfriend?" asked Littletato.<br />
"No, I'm single, hehe, I'm focusing more on my job, and finishing my college," said Yam.<br />
"Oh, what college are you doing?" asked Littletato.<br />
"It's mechanical engineering," replied Yam.<br />
"That sounds very cool, good luck on it!" said Littletato.<br />
"Thanks, Tato ^^," said Yam.<br />
She said that she was going to work, and said goodbye to Yam, he wished her luck and said goodbye back.<br />
Littletato closed the Vegebook website and turned off her computer, then she prepared herself to go to work.<br />
Then the girl walked to the living room's door, the match of Julia had finished, she got off her chair and walked to where Littletato was.<br />
Julia hugged Littletato tight and kissed her lips, "Good luck honey, good work," said Julia, smiling.<br />
"Thanks, honey," said Littletato, kissing Julia's lips back.<br />
Then Littletato started to walk to her job, she arrived there and started working on her technology and programming job.<br />
<br />
After some hours of working, it was six PM, Littletato got all of her stuff and left the company building, she started walking home.<br />
Julia was watching a game Livestream on Vegetube with her feet on the computer's table, she was eating a chocolate stuffed biscuit.<br />
Littletato arrived home and opened the door, she locked the door and gave a kiss on Julia's lips.<br />
"Welcome home honey," said Julia, smiling and looking at her.<br />
"Thanks, hon," replied Littletato, who walked to the bedroom and changed herself.<br />
Then Littletato made something for her and Julia to eat, she brought Julia's plate to her, and left it on top of Julia's computer table, close to her laptop.<br />
After that, Littletato ate and drank a little water, then she sat on her computer's chair and turned her computer on.<br />
The girl waited for the computer to turn on and opened the Mozilla Firefox web browser.<br />
After that, she opened the Vegetube website to search for a rock song, she searched for one and chose it, putting it to play.<br />
Littletato looked to her right and saw Julia, she hugged Julia tight and kissed her lips, saying "I love you".<br />
Julia said I love you back and kissed Littletato's lips.<br />
Then Julia closed the game Livestream, she opened the game Countable Vegetrike 1.6 to play again.<br />
The girl was in the terrorist team, she needed to plant a bomb, the Counter-terrorist team needed to defuse it.<br />
Julia was very good at it, she had made many kills and headshots.<br />
<br />
Littletato asked if she could play with her.<br />
Julia said yes and sent the IP of the server she was playing to the Vegesapp of Littletato, Julia used the Vegesapp Web website to send the IP of the server to Littletato.<br />
Littletato then opened Vegesapp on the browser of her computer to get the IP, also using Vegesapp Web.<br />
(Vegesapp is an app that you can install on your smartphone, it lets you chat with people, you need a phone number and a sim card to use it.)<br />
She opened the FPS game, came back to the browser, and copied the IP.<br />
Then opened the game again and pasted the IP.<br />
She started playing the game and was on the same team as Julia.<br />
Julia was on her right, playing on her laptop.<br />
When Julia died, Littletato could see where the enemy was, by looking at Julia's screen.<br />
Littletato and Julia had made many kills together, they were happy by playing the game.<br />
<br />
The couple was a little tired, they turned off their devices and Julia left her laptop charging.<br />
It was eleven at night, Littletato started preparing dinner with Julia.<br />
They ate together and waited a little to sleep, they drank some water too.<br />
Littletato and Julia locked the front door and turned off the lights.<br />
The girl held Julia in her arms, walking with her to the bedroom.<br />
Then she left Julia laid on the bed and laid beside her, covering herself and Julia with the blanket.<br />
She kissed Julia's lips and hugged her tight, sleeping with her, dreaming good dreams.

		Littletato woke up at six in the morning, looking at the sun hitting the bedroom's window crack, which was closed.<br />
She was a little tired, so she hugged Julia and slept again.<br />
<br />
After some time sleeping, the clock ringed and Littletato woke up.<br />
She looked at the time, it was eleven in the morning.<br />
She got out of bed and walked to the bathroom to do her morning necessities.<br />
After that, Littletato walked to the kitchen to prepare breakfast.<br />
Littletato prepared coffee with milk for her and Julia, leaving the two mugs on top of the table.<br />
She prepared some slices of bread with butter too.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato walked to the bedroom and kissed Julia's cheeks, saying:<br />
"Good morning, honey."<br />
<br />
Julia slowly opened her eyes and looked at Littletato.<br />
Littletato laid beside Julia and kissed her lips.<br />
Julia smiled while looking at Littletato, hugging her tight.<br />
Littletato hugged back and caressed Julia's hair, telling her that breakfast was ready.<br />
<br />
Julia walked to the bathroom to do her morning needs.<br />
She brushed her teeth, used some floss, and combed her hair.<br />
Then she walked to the kitchen, Littletato walked there with her.<br />
They both sat at the table and started eating.<br />
Julia and Littletato loved the taste of coffee in the morning.<br />
Julia looked at Littletato and said that she was going to call her sister to come by for a visit.<br />
Littletato said that she wished to meet Julia's sister, smiling.<br />
Julia smiled back and said:<br />
"I'm glad that you want to meet her, honey, hehe, thanks," said Julia.<br />
"Hehe, no problem hon," replied Littletato.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato finished eating and got up, going to the bedroom to prepare herself to work.<br />
Julia grabbed her phone and sent a message to her sister, asking if she would like to visit Julia's house.<br />
Her sister replied positively, saying that she was going to arrive there at six and a half in the afternoon.<br />
Julia walked to the bedroom and kissed Littletato's cheek, smiling.<br />
Littletato kissed Julia back and finished preparing herself to work.<br />
She grabbed her backpack and her phone, then walked to the living room's door.<br />
Littletato said that she was going to get back home at six in the afternoon.<br />
Julia said that her sister was going to arrive at six and a half in the afternoon.<br />
Then Littletato smiled and said goodbye to Julia, kissing her lips.<br />
Julia said goodbye back, smiling and waving her hand, then she locked the door of the house.<br />
<br />
Littletato started walking to her work while listening to some songs on her phone.<br />
She arrived at the building where she worked, she walked inside it and arrived at her desk.<br />
Littletato sat at her chair and turned on her computer.<br />
Her coworker Mia was on the desk at the left of Littletato.<br />
After turning her computer on, she opened a code editor and started fixing the errors of an app.<br />
Littletato sometimes was asked to fix smartphones at work, she knew how to fix them.<br />
While Littletato was working, Julia was preparing the house for her sister's visit, cleaning, and organizing it.<br />
Her sister was called Vitória, she was nineteen years old, Julia had eighteen.<br />
<br />
Littletato programmed more and more, fixing all the errors on the app.<br />
Mia said that she needed some help, and Littletato helped her.<br />
Mia was not understanding how she was supposed to do a part of the app that her boss told her.<br />
So Littletato explained that to her and gave a few examples too, showing these examples on the screen of Littletato's computer.<br />
After that, Mia said thanks and smiled at Littletato, then she continued doing her job.<br />
Littletato continued programming, she tested the app to see if the errors still happened.<br />
They did not happen again, she started working on the visual part of another app.<br />
<br />
Hours passed and Littletato finished her job, she got out of the building and started walking.<br />
She was walking back home while listening to some songs on her phone.<br />
Then she noticed some televisions on a shop window, Littletato paused the music and listened to the TV.<br />
It said that a war was happening in Las Vegas and the vegetables were fighting against some animals that were invading the city.<br />
Littletato became a little sad to know that, she picked up her phone and opened the gallery app.<br />
She looked at a picture of her and Julia hugging tight, smiling.<br />
Littletato smiled and became a little happier, forgetting about the war in Las Vegas.<br />
She looked at the time and saw that it was almost six and a half in the afternoon.<br />
Littletato turned off the phone screen and started walking back home again.<br />
The girl arrived there and opened the front door.<br />
She kissed Julia's lips and hugged her, after that, she walked to the bedroom and changed herself.<br />
They both walked to the living room and waited for Vitória to come by.<br />
<br />
After some time waiting, Vitória arrived.<br />
Littletato said hello to Vitória and she said hello back.<br />
Julia said that Littletato was her girlfriend, and Vitória was happy to know that.<br />
Vitória hugged Julia tight and said: "I missed you so much, sis!"<br />
"I missed you too, sis," replied Julia.<br />
Then Vitória walked close to Littletato and shook her hand.<br />
Vitória sat on the couch and smiled at Littletato, they started to talk.

		Vitória said that there were great jobs in the city that she lived.<br />
Littletato said that she already had a great job in San Francisco, working for a technology company.<br />
"Oh, that's great Littletato," said Vitória.<br />
"Thanks," replied Littletato.<br />
"So, what you been up to, sis?" asked Vitória.<br />
"Nothing much, I just bought this house with my girlfriend and we are living here.<br />
This city is great," replied Julia.<br />
<br />
Julia walked to the kitchen and started making the afternoon coffee.<br />
Then Littletato and Vitória walked to the kitchen, the trio started to eat while talking.<br />
"So, how is your job, Littletato?" asked Vitória.<br />
<br />
"Well, I work in a technology company, I make apps, programs, and fix smartphones sometimes.<br />
It is great, programming has been a great passion for me.<br />
I'm so happy, hehe," replied Littletato while smiling, looking at Vitória.<br />
<br />
"Oh, that's great, I'm happy for you Littletato, or, should I say... sister-in-law?" asked Vitória.<br />
"Yes, you're my sister-in-law, hehe," said Littletato while smiling a little.<br />
<br />
Vitória smiled back and looked to Julia, asking: "So, do you work, Julia?"<br />
"No, only Littletato works," replied Julia, looking at Littletato.<br />
"I see," said Vitória.<br />
"What do you work with, Vitória?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I am a designer, I design the logos and banners for the companies," replied Vitória.<br />
"Oh, that sounds cool," replied Littletato.<br />
"Thanks," replied Vitória while smiling.<br />
"Do you have any hobbies, Littletato?" asked Vitória.<br />
<br />
"Yes, I code, I also like to play games on my computer.<br />
Sometimes I and Julia get out for a walk or the park, or a bike ride, what about you, Vitória?" asked Littletato.<br />
<br />
"I like to go to the gym, play games too, and listen to music, rock, metal, electronic, I also do barbecue sometimes," said Vitória while giggling a little.<br />
"That looks to be very fun," replied Littletato while smiling a little.<br />
<br />
After talking a little, Vitória was leaving, she needed to go back to the city she lives in.<br />
The trio walked to the front door, Vitória hugged Julia and told her to sent her a message on Vegesapp.<br />
Vitória shook the hand of Littletato.<br />
The couple said goodbye to Vitória while smiling.<br />
Vitória got inside her car and turned it on, she waved goodbye to Julia and Littletato, driving away.<br />
Julia turned to Littletato and smiled, hugging her.<br />
"So, do you liked my sister, hon?" asked Julia.<br />
"Yes, she's pretty interesting, hon," replied Littletato, kissing Julia's lips.<br />
"Hehe, I'm happy because of that, I love you so much honey," said Julia.<br />
"I love you too, my little potato," replied Littletato.<br />
<br />
The couple walked inside the house, it was eleven at night.<br />
They locked the front door of the house, Julia walked to the kitchen with Littletato.<br />
Julia started looking for something to eat, she decided to prepare rice and beans for dinner.<br />
Littletato helped her prepare dinner, they finished it and sat at the table to eat.<br />
"Hey, honey, when I moved into San Francisco, I thought that it would be hard for me to get used to the city, it is so big.<br />
But since we started living together, I gained a lot of confidence, and I don't fear the city anymore.<br />
Because of you, so... thanks, honey," said Julia, looking at Littletato.<br />
<br />
"Hehe, no problem, honey, I'm glad that I could help you boost your confidence, honey, I was scared at first too.<br />
But seeing you, living here with no problem, listening to you say what you think about the city and why you love it...<br />
It made me love San Francisco here, and it made me love you too, it made me want to live with you here.<br />
I was loving you so much at that time when I started working in San Francisco.<br />
And I still love you very much, honey," said Littletato, who gave a kiss on Julia's lips.<br />
Julia smiled and kissed Littletato back, continuing to eat.<br />
They both finished eating and did their night necessities, they walked to the bedroom and laid on the bed.<br />
Covering themselves with the blanket, hugging tight, and sleeping together, having good dreams.<br />
<br />
Some hours have passed, Littletato woke up and looked at the hours, it was six in the morning.<br />
She got up and walked to the bathroom to do her morning needs.<br />
After that, Littletato walked to the kitchen and picked up her phone.<br />
She put to play a song of an anime called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZIqgCHrhRM" target="_blank">Yuru Camp</a>", it was a very calm song with violins, banjos, and flutes.<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZIqgCHrhRM" target="_blank" class="text_light_salmon text_hover_light_salmon">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZIqgCHrhRM</a><br />
The anime was about girls camping, Littletato loved that anime, it was so calming and relaxing.<br />
She was very happy listening to the songs of the anime and was also happy when she watched the anime for the first time.<br />
Yuru Camp reminded her of her childhood memories and when she rode her bicycle, the mornings she had.<br />
It was a very good song, she started to prepare breakfast while listening to it.<br />
Littletato made a sandwich for her and Julia, she left the two plates on the table and made a juice for them to drink.<br />
She walked to the bedroom and woke up Julia with a kiss on her lips.<br />
Then Julia got up and walked to the bathroom to do her morning needs.<br />
After that, Julia walked to the kitchen and sat at the table, Littletato was there too, she sat beside Julia.<br />
Julia asked what song was playing, Littletato said that it was the song of an anime called Yuru Camp.<br />
<br />
Julia said that she already watched that anime, she said that it was very good and relaxing.<br />
Littletato said that she loved the anime, and wanted to rewatch it sometime with Julia.<br />
They drank the juice and ate the sandwich, Julia thought that it was very delicious.<br />
After that, Julia and Littletato walked to the living room.<br />
Julia turned on the TV and selected the app Vegeflix.<br />
She searched through Vegeflix's library for a specific anime.<br />
She could not find it, so she opened a website on the Internet where she watched anime sometimes.<br />
Julia searched for "Yuru Camp" there and found it, she looked at Littletato and asked if she wanted to watch it.<br />
Littletato replied positively, Julia selected the anime, Littletato walked to the kitchen and paused the music that was playing on her phone.<br />
Then she walked back to the living room and sat beside Julia, hugging her tight.<br />
Julia put the first episode of Yuru Camp to play on the TV.<br />
<br />
The anime showed a girl with blue hair, her name was Rin, she was getting her bicycle out of her house and going to a place to camp.<br />
On the way, she saw a pink-haired girl sleeping on a bench, she thought that girl would get a cold from sleeping there.<br />
Littletato saw that and the nostalgia hit her, she thought about the first time that she watched Yuru Camp.<br />
She was very happy and smiling a lot, she still has that same love for the anime that she had before.<br />
Julia was smiling too, watching Yuru Camp with Littletato, it was so much fun.<br />
Littletato was caressing Julia's hair, smiling, watching Rin camping.<br />
Camping looked to be so much fun to Littletato, she wanted to try it sometime.<br />
Yuru Camp showed her how awesome, relaxing, and fun camping is.<br />
Julia wanted to try it too, she asked Littletato if she wanted to camp with her, Littletato said yes.<br />
Julia was very happy, she looked at Rin, camping, it seemed so relaxing and fun, Rin looked so happy.<br />
<br />
Then, after watching the episode for some time, it ended.<br />
Julia and Littletato drank some water, then they used the bathroom and walked to the bedroom.<br />
The couple laid on the bed and covered themselves with the blanket.<br />
Littletato hugged Julia tight and closed her eyes, sleeping with her.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 15/09/2017 and reviewed it on 28/08/2020.<br />
It was so much fun to write and review it, I reviewed it while listening to this mix on Vegetube here:<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZIqgCHrhRM" target="_blank">Yuru Camp △ - OST - ソロキャン△のすすめ - Solo Camp 10 Hours</a><br />
I love the anime Yuru Camp, it is so fun and relaxing, calming, I love to watch it.<br />
That's why I put it on the chapter, because I love it, and I reviewed this chapter while listening to the soundtrack of it.<br />
Thank you for watching- I mean, for reading, hehe. ^^<br />
Watch Yuru Camp, it is a very good anime, it will have a second season, I will watch it. :3<br />

		Littletato was drawing something on her computer using a program called Paint Tool SAI.<br />
It was a program where you could draw digitally, using pencils, brushes, and make line art.<br />
She liked to use that program to draw stuff, she finished drawing a potato some days ago.<br />
Littletato was drawing an anime girl today, the girl had yellow hair and blue eyes.<br />
She was drawing the girl while listening to some songs of the Future Bounce genre on Vegetube.<br />
Julia was in the bedroom using her laptop, talking with some friends on Vegebook and Vegewitter.<br />
Littletato was a little hungry and asked if Julia wanted to make dinner with her.<br />
Julia said yes and they both walked to the kitchen, they prepared rice with beans and some salad to eat.<br />
They ate together while talking a little, looking at each other, and smiling.<br />
"Hey, honey, what you were drawing there?" asked Julia, looking at the screen of Littletato's computer.<br />
"It's just an idea that I had, of an anime girl with an orange cat on her lap, what do you think sweetie?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think it is very good honey, you're so good at drawing, I wanted to know how to draw as well as you," replied Julia.<br />
"Hehe, thanks honey, I'm happy that you think that, I would love to teach you how to draw someday," said Littletato.<br />
<br />
Then they finished eating, they cleaned up the table and Littletato helped Julia wash the dishes.<br />
They both walked to the living room, Littletato turned on her computer and opened the Paint Tool SAI program.<br />
Julia sat beside her, looking at the screen, Littletato opened the file of the drawing of the anime girl with an orange cat.<br />
Littletato started teaching Julia how to draw, she hid the line art of the drawing to show Julia how to draw the line art.<br />
She drew and looked at Julia, giving the mouse for her to try, Julia started drawing the line art, clicking with the mouse.<br />
Julia was very good at it, she knew how to draw very easily, Littletato smiled while looking at her, being proud.<br />
Julia started drawing cats, stars, cars, Littletato was surprised, she was very happy that Julia could draw so well.<br />
"Hey honey, maybe you should download Paint Tool SAI on your computer, you're very good at drawing!" said Littletato.<br />
"Yes, I agree, can you send me the link so I can download it?" asked Julia.<br />
"Yes honey," said Littletato, then she sent the download link of the program to Julia through Vegesapp Web.<br />
Julia opened her laptop and turned it on, opening Mozilla Vegefox and opening the link, putting the program to download.<br />
Julia said she was a little tired, Littletato said that too, they both turned off their devices and gone to the bedroom.<br />
They laid on the bed and covered themselves with the blanket, hugging tight and sleeping well.<br />
<br />
Julia and Littletato started dreaming together, they were on a cold planet, a blue planet.<br />
Julia was shivering, hugging herself, and sighing, she wanted to find somewhere warm to stay.<br />
She looked around and did not know the environment, she was not used to alien things.<br />
She was in doubt about the animals and life on that planet, she was curious and wanted to learn more and more about the place.<br />
There was a strange creature close to them, it had a human shape, his head was a screen, they did not understand what it said.<br />
Looks like it was speaking an alien language, it was looking a little surprised and also happy, like he never saw humans before.<br />
The couple could understand his language a little bit, he said that he was called Spet.<br />
He stopped looking at them and walked to his house, entering it and closing the door.<br />
Julia and Littletato started walking around the planet, looking at some strange animals.<br />
They noticed that they had a multi-tool, it could mine gems and ores, it could also manipulate the terrain and fight aliens.<br />
The couple also had a jetpack or jump pack, with which they could jump and climb stuff.<br />
Julia started walking close to a red plant and collected it with her hands, she received the oxygen element.<br />
They had an Exo suit, it was like a backpack where they could store things and technologies, it also helped them stay alive.<br />
Julia opened the inventory of her Exo suit and saw that she had the oxygen element on her inventory.<br />
She had a device in her Exo suit called Life Support, it helped them to stay alive, she used her oxygen to refuel the device.<br />
Littletato did that too, they thought that the planet they were on was very weird.<br />
They both started walking close to a spaceship, it recognized them like it was their spaceship.<br />
The couple jumped on top of the spaceship and the door of it opened, they entered it and sat.<br />
<br />
Littletato did not know how to drive the spaceship, so she pulled a switch that was in the same position where the keys were in cars.<br />
The spaceship turned on, they heard a laser sound, a sound of something alien being activated.<br />
Littletato pushed a button, the spaceship took off and began to hover in the air, they were a little scared by that.<br />
Littletato grabbed the steering wheel of the spaceship and moved it to the right, turning the spaceship in 360º.<br />
"Are you sure that you know how to drive this spaceship honey?" asked Julia which was behind Littletato.<br />
"No honey, I'm just trying to learn how to drive it," said Littletato.<br />
The beak of the spaceship was pointing at an animal on the planet, Littletato pressed a button which she did not know what did.<br />
A laser was shot at the animal, it died, that laser came from the spaceship, it was used to mine asteroids in space.<br />
"Oops," said Littletato with a worried face, looking at the animal.<br />
Then a Sentinel appeared close to the spaceship, scanning them, it looks like they committed a space crime and had a wanted level there.<br />
Littletato stepped on the accelerator of the spaceship and began to fly around, trying to escape the sentinel, which was like a planetary policeman.<br />
She wanted to leave the planet to escape and pointed the beak of the spaceship up.<br />
The spaceship passed through the atmosphere and the couple arrived in space.<br />
Littletato thought that it was beautiful out there, with a lot of planets, space, and the sun of that galaxy.<br />
<br />
The galaxy was called Rameses B, Littletato could upload the info of the galaxy and gain units, which were like space money.<br />
Littletato stepped on the accelerator of the spaceship and began flying around the galaxy.<br />
She saw an asteroid and pushed the same button that killed the animal, the spaceship fired its laser and mined the asteroid.<br />
The spaceship collected the elements from the asteroid, which was silver, it could be used to build heat and toxic protections.<br />
"This game is very fun!" said Littletato, excited when firing the laser.<br />
"Wait... are we in a game?" asked Julia in doubt.<br />
"Uh... I guess so, this looks like a game that I saw some months ago, so I thought this was that game," said Littletato.<br />
"Weird... hey honey, can we go to another planet?" asked Julia.<br />
"Of course honey, what type of planet do you want?" asked Littletato.<br />
"A very hot one, I was beginning to freeze at the planet we were before," said Julia.<br />
"Okay hon," said Littletato, which started to drive the spaceship, looking for a warm planet.<br />
She found one and began entering its atmosphere, the window of the spaceship was a little warm because of the atmospheric pressure.<br />
<br />
Littletato parked the spaceship close to a planet base and came out of the spaceship along with Julia.<br />
They started walking around the planet looking for something to do.<br />
The Life Support device of Littletato was a little empty, she collected some oxygen with her hands, and refilled it.<br />
Julia did that too, she also recharged her Hazard Protection device with Sodium.<br />
That device was used to continually monitor and stabilize the user's environment, protecting the user from heat, cold, toxicity, or radiation.<br />
Littletato started looking at a crashed spaceship, there was a terminal close to it.<br />
She started reading the log of the machine, it looked like some space pirates shot this spaceship, trying to steal a rare plant that it had.<br />
Littletato discovered that the pilot of the spaceship escaped by running around this planet.<br />
The pilot also found a deposit of very rare materials, some elements used to recharge protection devices, and some materials to build upgrades.<br />
Littletato could see the location of the deposit on her radar, she asked Julia if the wanted to go there.<br />
Julia said yes, after that, she looked at a small animal that was close to them, it looked very cute.<br />
Julia tried to give food to it and it ate the food, it began to follow Julia.<br />
"Ah, honey, it is so cute, can we bring it with us?" asked Julia smiling at the animal.<br />
"Of course honey, hehe," said Littletato smiling.<br />
Then Julia grabbed the animal and began to follow Littletato.<br />
Littletato grabbed some materials that were closed to the crashed spaceship and walked to her spaceship.<br />
Julia and she entered the spaceship, Littletato turned the spaceship on, taking off and driving to the deposit.<br />
Then the dream changed to another dream, Littletato and Julia were sleeping happy, together, in love with each other.

		Littletato then woke up, she looked at the clock and saw that was six in the morning, she then looked at the calendar and realized that it was Saturday, then she hugged Julia tight and slept again while caressing the hair of Julia.<br />
<br />
She woke up at eleven o'clock in the morning, and then she woke up Julia with a kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Julia came to the kitchen to make breakfast, they made coffee, slices of bread with butter, and then ate it.<br />
Julia suggested for them to hang out a little, Littletato said that it was a good idea.<br />
<br />
They got out of the house and locked it, Julia said that she knew a park close to there, they started walking there on foot while looking at the scenery.<br />
The couple arrived at the park and sat at a bench, looking at the trees and people.<br />
<br />
While being in the park of San Francisco, Littletato and Julia noticed that someone appeared there, it was Yam, the friend of Littletato.<br />
Julia said she did not know him, and Littletato introduced him to her.<br />
He sat at the right side of Littletato and began to talk with them.<br />
<br />
"The weather is pleasant today, right?" asks Yam.<br />
<br />
"Yea, it is very comfy, especially for relaxing into places like this," replies Littletato while looking at some trees.<br />
<br />
Yam smiled while looking at her.<br />
<br />
"So, do you have a job, Yam?" asked Julia, smiling while looking at him.<br />
"Yes, I work at a grocery store," replied him.<br />
<br />
"Oh, that's cool, you should have a lot of stuff to eat for free right?" asked Julia while giggling a little.<br />
"Yea, but the boss doesn't let me eat the food so often, he lets me bring some food to my house when I'm needing, but that's deducted from my salary," explains him.<br />
"Oh, I understand, but it's cool that you have a place to shop for food," replies Julia.<br />
"Yep, I agree with you, Julia.<br />
Hey Littletato, do you ever thought about traveling to Texas? I heard it is a really good place to live, its citizens are chocolate bars," says Yam.<br />
<br />
"No, I never thought about going there, and I don't even have a car to travel that far," replies Littletato.<br />
"Ah, I understand," says Yam, which starts to look at some people walking on the sidewalk, distracted.<br />
<br />
"Oh, honey, I think your aunt Luisa lives there right?" asks Julia in excitement while looking at Littletato.<br />
"Yes, we should visit her sometime when we have a car, right my dear?" asks Littletato while smiling excitedly.<br />
<br />
Yam looks at his cellphone to see a message he received, he reads it and then goes back to looking at the trees.<br />
<br />
"Yea, I agree," says Julia, who gives Littletato a tight hug while caressing her hair.<br />
Littletato gives a kiss on the cheek of Julia and giggles a little.<br />
Yam looks at the couple and smiles, thinking: "Aww, they are so cute together".<br />
<br />
"I love you my little potato," said Julia, lovingly to Littletato.<br />
"I love you too, my sweet flower," said Littletato while smiling happily at Julia.<br />
<br />
Yam stood up.<br />
"Well girls, I gotta go, my sister is alone at my house, she is in town, I bought her favorite chocolates," said him while looking at his cellphone.<br />
"She is visiting me, I should go quick.<br />
So... It was a pleasure to meet you Julia", says him while shaking the hand of Julia.<br />
Julia smiles and says, "It was a pleasure to meet you too, Yam".<br />
<br />
Yam starts walking backward and says, "Goodbye Littletato," while waving his hand to her.<br />
"Goodbye Yam," says Littletato while smiling and waving her hand to him.<br />
<br />
Then he puts his cellphone inside of his pocket and starts walking normally in the direction of his house.<br />
<br />
Littletato hugs Julia tight, looking at the clock of her cellphone, she sees it is thirteen o'clock in the afternoon.<br />
"Hey honey, I think we should go back home," says Littletato, who gives a quick kiss on the lips of Julia.<br />
"Oh, okay my dear, but I think we should go to the supermarket first, we are almost out of bread, and I would love some Coca-Cola right now," replies Julia while smiling.<br />
"Okay hon, let's go there," says Littletato.<br />
<br />
Then they walk to the marketplace to buy food, Littletato buys bread, rice and beans, and a bottle of Coca-Cola.<br />
<br />
After that, they started walking back home with the bags in hand.<br />
They arrived home and Julia prepared the lunch, Littletato helped her, they ate and got a little tired, then slept.<br />
<br />
Littletato woke up first and looked at the hours, it was six at night.<br />
Then she made dinner and called Julia, they ate together while talking about some things.<br />
Littletato finished the food and brought the bottle of Coca-Cola to the living room, telling Julia to come there to watch a movie with her.<br />
Julia walked to the living room and sat by the side of Littletato on the couch, hugging her, she gave a quick kiss on the lips of Littletato.<br />
They had the Vegeflix app on the television and watched a movie while drinking the rest of coca-cola.<br />
<br />
After a while, the movie ended and the Coca-cola bottle was empty.<br />
<br />
Julia was sleeping on the couch, Littletato grabbed her with her arms and walked to the bedroom, leaving her on top of the bed.<br />
She closed the window and laid by the side of Julia, hugging her tight and kissing her neck.<br />
Julia shivered and moved lightly, giggling a little with a cute voice.<br />
Littletato covered herself and Julia with the blanket.<br />
"Good night honey," said Littletato with a gentle voice.<br />
"Good... night my dear," said Julia, slowly falling asleep again, smiling and humming with happiness.<br />
They both slept together in the silent night.

<br />
Littletato looked at the clock and it was seven in the morning, she hugged Julia that was in the bed sleeping, kissed her lips, and slept while smiling.<br />

"I love you too honey, you make me so happy," said Julia in a low voice, smiling at Littletato and hugging her.<br />
"You're my little bean, hehe," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
<br />
They both got up, walked to the living room, and sat on the couch.<br />
The couple had a television and a video game called Vbox, they played a lot of games together and had a lot of fun.<br />

		It was a Monday, Littletato woke up and yawned, she had to get ready for work.<br />
She looked at the clock and it was six in the morning, Julia was still sleeping.<br />
Littletato came to the kitchen to prepare breakfast.<br />
She walked close to the window and saw the beautiful sunrise, then took a picture of it with her phone.<br />
<br />
She finished preparing breakfast, walked to the bedroom, and tried to wake up Julia.<br />
Julia woke up and hugged Littletato tight, caressing her hair.<br />
She kissed Littletato in her lips and smiled.<br />
"I love you, honey, you're so cute," said Julia to Littletato.<br />
"I love you too my cutie, my little flower," replied her, that caressed Julia's hair.<br />
"Let's go eat breakfast, hon," said Littletato.<br />
<br />
They both walked to the kitchen and sat at the table.<br />
The couple felt the warm sun touch their skins.<br />
Littletato and Julia smiled while looking at each other.<br />
They were drinking hot chocolate and eating slices of bread with butter.<br />
<br />

She was ready, they both walked to the front door, Julia hugged Littletato tight.<br />

She puts on her earphones and puts a song to play on her phone, on the Vegetify app, it is a song of the Dubstep genre.<br />
Then she continues to walk to work while listening to the song.<br />
The girl looks at the trees and nature, the people walking around and the morning in the city.<br />
She thinks that it is so beautiful, human nature, the stars, the universe.<br />
Littletato likes to think about the unknown, about science, discovering new things.<br />
<br />
After walking a little, she arrives at her workplace and enters it.<br />
She pauses the song and removes her earphones, then walks to her desk.<br />
Littletato turns her computer on and says "Hi" to some co-workers.<br />
The computer turns on and Littletato opens her text editor.<br />
Her boss sends a message to her through a messaging program that the company where Littletato works created.<br />
The boss says that she needs to make the typing part of a smartphone messaging app.<br />
She sends to Littletato a text file saying how the typing part needs to be made.<br />
Littletato receives it and reads, then she starts programming the typing part.<br />
<br />
Then after some time typing and coding, Littletato finishes the part of the app.<br />
She sends the file with the code to her boss.<br />
Her boss tests the code file to see if it works, it does.<br />
Then her boss sends a message through the company's messaging program.<br />
The message says, "Hey Littletato, can you fix this part here? the part where the user types the message text, it's a bit small, can you enlarge it, also paint it white and give it a gray border?"<br />
<br />
Littletato replies positively and continues to work on the code.<br />
She finishes it and sends it again to her boss, she checks it and says that it is good.<br />
Then Littletato starts to fix some bugs (errors) in another app that the company needs to make.<br />
<br />
After sometime coding, working time ends.<br />
Littletato sends the debugged (fixed) code file to her boss and turns off the computer.<br />
She takes her things and gets up from her desk, then leaves the building and starts walking home.<br />
While walking, she sees the lights of the city and the lamp poles.<br />
She thinks about how people can get together and know each other, Littletato loves to study human nature.<br />
<br />
She thinks that she needs to buy some food and starts to walk to the supermarket.<br />
Littletato arrives there and walks to the supermarket shelves.<br />
She gets a shopping cart, walks to the snack part of the market, and grabs a pack of Doritos.<br />
The girl walks to some refrigerators, opens one of them, and takes a bottle of Coca-cola.<br />
Then she puts it inside the cart and walks to the cashier, she pays and grabs the bags, then starts to walk home again.<br />
<br />
Then she arrives at home and knocks on the door.<br />
Julia opens and gives a big hug in Littletato, smiling happily and saying, "You're here honey!"<br />
Littletato kisses Julia in her lips and smiles, then says, "I'm back, my baby".<br />
<br />

<br />
They open the app called Vegeflix and put up "Captain Vegerica: Vegetable War" to watch.<br />

They get glazed in the movie and keep cheering for the characters they like, they love to see the special effects and the powers of the heroes.<br />
Julia says she likes the Black Vegenther, Littletato says she likes the Black Vegwidow.<br />
Julia lays her head on Littletato's lap and she keeps caressing Julia's hair.<br />
<br />
After a few hours of watching and eating, the film ends.<br />
Julia and Littletato feel a little tired, they turn off the television.<br />

Then she puts the empty Doritos pack inside the trash bin.<br />
<br />
They walk to the bedroom, Littletato lies on the bed and Julia lies down next to her.<br />

"Your hair is so soft love, I love to pet it," says her.<br />
"Thanks, my dear, I love when you pet me like this, it makes me feel so special," replies Julia.<br />
"Hehe, I love you my little sweet potato," says Littletato.<br />

		It was a Tuesday, Littletato was dreaming of a field, a big and tall wheat field with a sunrise, she looked close to the sun and smiled.<br />
A heavy wind hit her and she tried not to fall, she felt great there, and calm, feeling the wind and nature, she loved to see nature in all of its forms.<br />
She started to walk close to an old house, then noticed that she was at a farm, the house was made of red bricks and had some wooden parts, the door was falling and almost completely broken.<br />
<br />
Littletato walked close to there and entered the house, she lighted up a candle and looked at all the items in the little house.<br />
There were shovels, hoes, seeds, and fertilizers, she got out of the house and saw that a storm was coming, the wind was very heavy and the trees were swinging a lot.<br />
She grabbed a large barrel and climbed up in a box, she placed the barrel on top of the roof.<br />
Then Littletato walked inside the house and saw that there was a refrigerator in there, she opened it and grabbed a can of Coca-cola.<br />
After that, she grabbed a chair and laid it on the ground, outside of the house, she sat there and drank her Coca-cola while waiting for the storm to come.<br />
Littletato looked at the storm and finished drinking her Coca-cola, she closed her eyes and relaxed in the chair.<br />
<br />
After some time, she felt some water drops on her arm, then opened her eyes and saw that it was starting to rain very hard, she quickly picked up her chair and walked inside the house.<br />
She left the chair there and closed her window, then sat at the chair and contemplated the beautiful rain, shaking all the trees with the wind, watering them all, watering her wheat field.<br />
Littletato liked to have that farm, it felt so nice and quiet, so relaxing and calming.<br />
<br />
She had a bed in there too, she wore some light clothes and laid on her bed.<br />
Littletato slept on her bed while listening to the sounds of the rain, making her sleep well.<br />
<br />
Littletato woke up and noticed that she was hugging Julia, she looked at the clock and saw that it was six in the morning, then gave a quick kiss on the lips of Julia.<br />
She woke up Julia and walked to the kitchen with her, they hugged and looked at the sunrise, it was very beautiful, some birds were singing in the trees.<br />
They both walked to the bathroom to do their morning needs.<br />
After that, Julia walked to the kitchen to prepare breakfast, she finished preparing it and she called Littletato to the kitchen.<br />
Littletato was combing her hair, she said "Coming, baby," while looking at the mirror, then she continued combing her hair.<br />
She walked to the kitchen and sat at the table in front of Julia, they started eating.<br />
Julia had made eggs with bacon and hot chocolate.<br />
"It is very good, hon, thanks," said Littletato, smiling at Julia.<br />
"Thanks, honey, I'm happy that you liked it," replied Julia.<br />
<br />
They finished eating and Littletato got up.<br />
She walked to her room to prepare for her job.<br />
Littletato was sat in her bed, putting on her socks, Julia walked there and hugged Littletato.<br />
They both smiled and Littletato gave a kiss on the lips of Julia.<br />
"I love you, hon, I miss you when you go to work," says Julia in a sad tone.<br />
"Oh, I love you too, hon, I miss you when I'm at work too," says Littletato, that hugs Julia tight.<br />
"Hmm... But it's okay, cause I'll see you after work, and I'll have you all to myself, hehe," replies her while smiling.<br />
"Hehe, yes, I'll be all yours," says Littletato while smiling naughtily.<br />
<br />
Then she gets up and gets her bag to go to work.<br />
She walks to the front door and Julia follows her.<br />
Littletato gets out and hugs Julia, giving a long kiss on her lips.<br />
Then she starts to walk to her job.<br />
She puts a rock playlist to play on her phone, using the Vegetify app.<br />
<br />
Julia is at home, she locks the door and walks to the kitchen.<br />
Then she grabs a pack of Doritos and a can of Coca-cola that was hidden somewhere in the fridge.<br />
She walks to the bedroom and sits on a chair, in front of the chair there is a table and on top of the table, there is the laptop of Julia.<br />
Julia opens her laptop and turns it on, then leaves her Doritos pack and can of Coca-cola on top of the bed.<br />
<br />
She opens the Vegewitch.tv website and opens a Livestream of the streamer called "Patife".<br />
He is playing the game Call of Vegeduty: Vegetablezone with his friend Funky Vegetable Cat.<br />
It is a game of the first-person shooter type, the objective is to be the last one alive, and there are teams of players.<br />
There is also a gas that comes from the border of the map to kill the player, forcing them to come closer to each other and fight.<br />
Julia opens her pack of Doritos and the can of Coca-cola.<br />
Then she starts to watch the Livestream while drinking and eating.<br />
<br />
Patife is playing, he runs to a place to hide when the gas comes and the area gets narrower.<br />
Then Funky Vegetable Cat says that there is an enemy close to the red mark that he made on the map.<br />
Patife looks in the direction where Funky marked and tries to shoot there with his long-range sniper.<br />
With luck, he takes one guy down, then he runs inside a house and opens some boxes to grab items, money, and some guns.<br />
He gets a car and Funky enters inside it, Patife starts to drive away from the gas and close to the safe zone.<br />
Then Patife stops the car and gets out of it, hiding right after.<br />
There are few players alive, and they are close to Patife because he is in the area of the safe zone.<br />
Julia gets glazed up looking at the game, she smiles and gets excited, banging her feet on the ground.<br />
Patife gets inside a house and goes to the second floor, Funky is on the ground.<br />
He marks an enemy with a green marker, Patife sees it and shoots there with his sniper.<br />
Patife kills one enemy and looks to the other window, then a player appears behind him and kills him quickly with two pistols.<br />
He gets a little angry, saying that he did not hear the enemy coming, Funky quickly goes inside the house and kills the enemy.<br />
Then he walks outside and tries to run to a box to revive Patife.<br />
Funky is trying to revive Patife in the box but gets killed from behind.<br />
He gets angry and they both leave the match.<br />
Then Julia opens the Livestream of Cellbit, he is playing a riddle game again, she watches it while drinking and eating.<br />
<br />
After some time, Julia gets tired and yawns a little, her phone vibrates, showing that she got a message from someone on the Vegesapp app.<br />
It is a message from Vitória, she clicks the message and Vegesapp opens, she lowers the volume of the Livestream of Cellbit that is ending.<br />
Then she sees the message, it is a picture of barbecue meat.<br />
Julia replies to the message saying, "That looks delicious, sis! I wish I was there with you to eat that 😋".<br />
"Hehe, maybe I could go there to make some barbecue for you sis 😊", replies Vitória.<br />
Then Julia replies with a message, saying, "Oh, I would love that ^^".<br />
Julia turns off the screen of her phone and lays it on the table, she closes the Livestream and opens a Livestream of songs of the Future Bass genre on Vegetube.<br />
She eats some Doritos and takes some sips of Coca-cola.<br />
Then grabs her phone and lies on the bed.<br />
She leaves the pack of Doritos and the can of Coca-cola on top of a table close to the bed.<br />
Julia starts to play a game on her phone while listening to the Future Bass Livestream and eating Doritos sometimes.<br />
<br />
Then, after playing a lot, Julia closes the game and finishes eating the pack of Doritos, the can of Coca-cola is already empty.<br />
Julia closes the browser and turns off the laptop, then closes it.<br />
She goes to the kitchen and throws the pack of Doritos and the can of Coca-cola inside the trash bin.<br />
Then she walks to the living room and lies on the couch.<br />
Julia turns the television on and leaves on a channel, playing, she stays fiddling with her cell phone.<br />
After some time, Littletato gets home, Julia gets up and goes to the front door, opens it, and hugs Littletato tight.<br />
"You're home!, honey, I love to see you back," says Julia.<br />
"I'm here honey, don't worry my dear, I'm all yours now," says Littletato in a calm voice while caressing the hair of Julia.<br />
"Hehe, I'm happy, I love when you pat me, hon," replies Julia.<br />
<br />
They both get inside and Littletato changes herself.<br />
Julia prepares the dinner and eats along with Littletato.<br />
Littletato asks, "What did you do today, love?"<br />
"Nothing much, I just watched two Livestreams, one from Patife and another one from Cellbit," replies her.<br />
"Did you ate something delicious?" asks Littletato.<br />
"No, I-I just ate some bread with butter and stuff," replies Julia while trying to hide the fact that she ate Doritos and Coca-cola.<br />
"Oh, it's good too," says Littletato.<br />
<br />
After eating, they walk to the bedroom, it is already night.<br />
They lie on the bed and Littletato hugs Julia from behind, they cover themselves with the blanket.<br />
Littletato gives a kiss on the neck of Julia, she giggles a little.<br />
"Good night, hon, I love you," says Littletato to Julia.<br />
"Good night, honey, I love you too, my little potato," replies her.<br />
Then they sleep, waiting for the next day.

		It was a Wednesday, Littletato was sleeping and dreaming.<br />
She was dreaming of a dream where she was lying on a cloud while looking at the sun, Julia was at her side.<br />
The cloud was pink and was high in the sky, Littletato looked down and saw the cities and buildings from up there.<br />
She did not have a fear of falling even if it was so high.<br />
Suddenly, a man sitting on a white cloud appeared there with an acoustic guitar.<br />
His cloud was moving a little slow and he started to sing in Mexican while playing his acoustic guitar.<br />
He said his name was Miguel and he continued to sing.<br />
Julia and Littletato thought that was so romantic, to hear him sing that song.<br />
Miguel said it was a song about his great-grandmother.<br />
"Remember me...<br />
Though I have to say goodbye<br />
Remember me<br />
Don't let it make you cry," sang him while playing his acoustic guitar.<br />
Littletato and Julia were touched and little tears fell from their eyes.<br />
Then Miguel has gone away while sitting in his cloud.<br />
<br />
After that, another cloud appeared there, it was a wide orange cloud and there was a stage on top of it with large loudspeakers.<br />
The cloud moved to the front of Julia and Littletato then stopped moving.<br />
A boy appeared there with an electric guitar, jamming it, he was in the middle of the stage.<br />
He said his name was Mizaque, but made it clear that it was with Z.<br />
Mizaque began playing his electric guitar, he was playing a Dubstep song with his guitar.<br />
Julia thought that it was amazing, "How could an electric guitar play Dubstep sounds?" thought her.<br />
Mizaque was playing the Dubstep song and was close to the drop, that was the chorus of the song, the most exciting part.<br />
He played the guitar and sang like "Weeeeum, byoou byoou Twa!, weeeeum, tutututututututu, bwaaaaa, gwah! gwah! bwaaaaaa".<br />
Littletato loved that, even if he looked a little crazy, waving his head to the beat of the song.<br />
Then Mizaque ran away with his orange cloud to play more songs for other people.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Julia felt like they were in an allegorical presentation, a lot of people doing things, and both of them watching it.<br />
Then a white cloud moved close to there with nothing on top of it, the couple thought that it was weird.<br />
After that, a fridge fell from space making a falling sound, it landed on the cloud without breaking or going through the cloud.<br />
A girl with gray hair appeared on top of the fridge, opened it, and grabbed a can of Coca-cola, she said "TPF, the Thought-Powered Fridge for your dreams".<br />
Littletato thought that it was an advertisement for a fridge or something.<br />
"Oops," the gray-haired girl looked at her un-existing clock, "I have to go back to my LonelyShip, bye-bye!" said her while smiling and waving her hand, she flew away in her cloud.<br />
<br />
Then a boy appeared in a cloud, he had his back to the couple, he was using his computer with his headphones.<br />
The boy said "I'm Teuqazi," he was looking at his screen and writing a story on a website called Littlegrape, it was a purple website that he made.<br />
Teuqazi was listening to some Dubstep songs on his computer while writing.<br />
He was smiling a lot, humming the bass of the song.<br />
The boy got up, removed his earphones, and walked close to a blue fridge, "TPF" was written on the fridge door.<br />
Teuqazi opened the door and picked up a can of Coca-cola from the fridge, then walked to his computer and sat at the chair again.<br />
He opened the Vegecord program on his computer and said "How boring..."<br />
Then he opened the Vegewitter website and said "How boring!"<br />
And then opened the Vegetube website and said "How boring!!!"<br />
After that, he received a message on Vegecord, he went to see who it was, it was a very good friend of his.<br />
He smiled and opened the notification to talk with that person.<br />
Littletato and Julia were happy looking at the boy, they felt his happiness.<br />
<br />
Littletato woke up and looked at Julia, she kissed Julia's lips.<br />
She remembered the song that the Mexican man was singing, the boy playing his electric guitar, the gray-haired girl, and the boy writing a story on his computer.<br />
The girl thought that it was a really weird dream.<br />
"How could a fridge fall on a cloud and not pass through it?<br />
It's only a dream, I shouldn't worry about that," thought her.<br />
She looked at the ceiling and thought that she had to go to work, but needed to have breakfast first.<br />
Littletato removed the blanket that was covering her and kissed Julia's forehead.<br />
She got up and walked to the bathroom, looking at the mirror and seeing her messy hair, she washed her face.<br />
The girl sighed and started to brush her teeth, after that, she used some floss and combed her hair.<br />
<br />
Then she walked to the kitchen and prepared breakfast, making two sandwiches with eggs, cheese, and mayonnaise.<br />
Littletato picked up two cups and filled them with milk and chocolate powder.<br />
She mixed the chocolate powder with the milk.<br />
The girl walked to the bedroom and lied on the bed, hugging Julia tight.<br />
"I love you, honey," said her, kissing Julia's cheek.<br />
Julia grumbled a little and smiled, still sleeping, she turned to face Littletato and kissed her lips.<br />
"I love you too, my sunshine," said Julia while smiling.<br />
"Let's have breakfast, baby," said Littletato to Julia.<br />
"Okay, honey," replied her.<br />
Julia yawned and stretched out, breaking out from the hug and getting up.<br />
She walked to the bathroom.<br />
"I'll wait for you at the kitchen, hon," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay, hon," said Julia.<br />
She washed her face, brushed her teeth, and used floss.<br />
Then she walked to the kitchen and sat at the table, in front of Littletato.<br />
They started to eat breakfast.<br />
"It's very good, sweetie, thanks," said Julia while eating her sandwich.<br />
"I'm happy that you appreciate it, hon," said Littletato as she smiled at Julia.<br />
<br />
They finished eating breakfast, Julia got up and walked to the living room, she sat on the couch and turned the television on.<br />
Littletato came there and kissed Julia's lips.<br />
"I have to go to work, honey," said Littletato to Julia.<br />
"Okay, baby," replied her.<br />
"I love you so much my baby, cutie," said Littletato, who hugged Julia tight.<br />
"I love you too, hon," replied her.<br />
Then Littletato walked to the bedroom and started preparing herself to work.<br />
She walked to the front door and Julia walked there too, Littletato hugged Julia tight and kissed her lips, saying goodbye.<br />
Julia said goodbye back and smiled at Littletato.<br />
Littletato started walking to work while listening to her favorite playlist of country music on her Vegetify app.<br />
<br />
Julia locked the front door and walked to the kitchen, she drank her whole bottle of water and filled it up again.<br />
Then she walked to the living room and sat on the couch, looking at the television, her phone by her side.<br />
She felt a little tired and laid on the couch, putting her arm below the pillow.<br />
An advertisement appeared on the television, it had a man saying things.<br />
<br />
"Are you tired of your boring life? are you tired of working a full day and doing nothing fun?<br />
Well, if the answer is yes, then I got the right thing to you, come live at the <a class="text_dark_blue" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/New World/SpaceLiving/en/" target="_blank">SpaceLiving</a> Network.<br />
A network of spaceships where you can live happily without having to work at all!<br />
It features a super-fast computer, a fridge that can create any food you think of;<br />
And a laser gun!<br />
Call now to win a free spaceship only for you!" said the man.<br />
Then the advertisement ended.<br />
Julia thought: "What? this must be fake... how they can give a free spaceship to someone? how they're gonna get people inside that spaceship?<br />
A fridge that creates anything you think of? I can't believe that..."<br />
She lowered the volume of the television and closed her eyes to sleep.<br />
Julia was thinking about Littletato, she was sleeping while smiling.<br />
She had good dreams while sleeping in the afternoon.

		It was a Thursday, Littletato was dreaming of pizzas, a lot of pizzas flying in the sky while she was sat on the surface of a desert.<br />
The sun was not too hot, it was a little chill there, the breeze was a little cold, she liked the weather.<br />
The girl noticed that she had wings, white wings made of feathers.<br />
Littletato flew high in the sky and ate some flying pizzas of pepperoni, they were delicious and moved like birds flapping their wings as they flew, she was smiling.<br />
The sky had candies too, flying candies, chocolate stuffed biscuits, gums, sodas to drink.<br />
She thought that she would become fat if she ate all of those things, there were so many of them, it was like the desert of food.<br />
<br />
Then the dream switched to another dream, she was driving a red car to Texas with Julia, Littletato was happy to do a trip with Julia.<br />
The car was convertible and the wind was hitting their hairs, Julia put her hand outside of the car to feel the wind.<br />
Littletato put to play some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRejhGxr69Y" target="_blank">folk songs</a> on the music player that the car had, they both sang the songs, they were so relaxing.<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRejhGxr69Y" target="_blank" class="text_light_salmon text_hover_light_salmon">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRejhGxr69Y</a><br />
Julia had mobile data on her phone and she sent a message to Vitória saying that she was on a trip with Littletato.<br />
Vitória said: "Send me pictures when you arrive there! 😊".<br />
Then Julia replied: "Of course sis! ^^".<br />
Julia started looking to the highway again, she looked at Littletato and smiled, Littletato smiled back.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
After some time has passed, it was afternoon, they were listening to a calmer song of the folk songs play-list.<br />
Littletato closed the roof of her red convertible car and relaxed on her seat.<br />
Julia hugged Littletato and kissed her cheek, Littletato smiled and kissed back.<br />
They had stopped in a nearby city and bought some things to eat if they became hungry, Julia opened the pack of Doritos and began eating.<br />
Littletato asked for one and opened her mouth, then Julia put one on her mouth, Littletato ate it.<br />
Then Julia opened a can of Coca-cola and drank a little, giving it to Littletato.<br />
Julia thought that the trip was so relaxing, listening to songs and eating, looking at the beautiful view.<br />
Littletato was very happy, she arrived at a city that she needed to pass through before arriving in Texas.<br />
She arrived at the entrance of the city and paid the toll, then started driving around the city.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato woke up, she looked at Julia and hugged her tight, kissing her lips.<br />
The birds were singing outside, she remembered the song that Julia and she were listening to in the car.<br />
She looked at the clock and noticed it was six in the morning.<br />
Littletato got up and turned the television on.<br />
An ad for the TPF fridge was on television, saying that if you were a citizen of the SpaceLiving Network, you could use the TPF fridge on your house.<br />
Littletato turned the volume of the television down and walked to the bathroom to do her morning needs.<br />
She brushed her teeth, used some floss, and combed her hair.<br />
Then she walked to the kitchen and prepared breakfast, it was eggs with bacon and hot chocolate.<br />
<br />
Littletato walked to the living room and opened the Vegeflix app on the television, she chose the Atypical series to watch on Vegeflix.<br />
She left the series paused and walked to the bedroom, waking up Julia with a kiss and a hug.<br />
Julia woke up and said to Littletato "I love you", Littletato said it back.<br />
Then Julia walked to the bathroom to do her morning needs, after that, she walked to the kitchen and saw the meal on top of the table.<br />
"It looks so delicious hon!" said Julia while smiling, looking at the food.<br />
"Thanks, hon, I'm happy that you like it," replied Littletato smiling.<br />
Littletato and Julia walked to the living room to eat breakfast while watching one episode of the Atypical series.<br />
They think this series is so fun to watch, it is a teen series, they enjoy watching it.<br />
<br />
After some time eating, they finished both the meal and the episode of Atypical.<br />
Littletato kissed Julia's lips and said that she needed to go to work.<br />
She walked to the bedroom and started preparing herself for work.<br />
Julia hugged her tight and kissed her cheek, Littletato kissed her back.<br />
Littletato then walked to the living room door and opened it, she hugged Julia tight and kissed Julia's lips again.<br />
"Hey honey, I think I'm going for a ride with my bike today, I'm gonna lock the house okay?" said Julia.<br />
"Okay hon, when are you going to arrive?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think I'll be here by noon if I can handle riding my bike a lot, hehe," replied Julia.<br />
"Oh, okay, good ride, honey," said Littletato while smiling.<br />
"Thanks, good luck at work," said Julia as she hugged Littletato.<br />
They both waved goodbye to each other, Littletato started walking to work while listening to some folk songs on her phone.<br />
<br />
Julia came back inside the house and drank some water because she was thirsty.<br />
Then she walked to the living room and grabbed the house's key, she also grabbed a backpack.<br />
She grabbed the key of her bicycle and moved her bicycle outside, locking the house.<br />
Julia started riding her bicycle around the city, she stored the key of the house inside her pocket.<br />
She wanted to go to a park in the city, she knew that there were a lot of people exercising there.<br />
Julia continued riding her bike and arrived there.<br />
She started circling the block, going fast while looking at the trees.<br />
The girl liked to ride her bicycle sometimes, it was good to refresh her mind, to calm herself, and stop thinking about the problems.<br />
Julia brought her wallet with her, she got out of the park and started riding to a market.<br />
When she arrived there, Julia parked her bike in a bike parking lot, locking her bike.<br />
<br />
She walked inside the market, bought a cold can of Coca-cola, and a packet of Doritos.<br />
Julia got out of the market and unlocked her bicycle.<br />
She started riding to another park that she knew in San Francisco, it had birds and lots of animals.<br />
Some people would go there to do a picnic, it had a beautiful and crystal clear river.<br />
Julia arrived there and parked her bike on a tree, locking it.<br />
She saw some people sat on the ground, some with their children, some with friends, it was a good park to relax.<br />
Julia sat on the grass, opened her can of Coca-cola, and her packet of Doritos.<br />
Some kids were running around, there was a brown dog too.<br />
She picked up her phone and put some relaxing music to play while drinking Coca-cola and eating Doritos.<br />
Suddenly, a kid walked close to her, looking at her Doritos packet, Julia paused the music, he asked for her to give him a little.<br />
She gave a little to him and he said thanks while smiling, walking back to his parents, eating the Doritos.<br />
Julia smiled back and put her music to play again, relaxing while eating and drinking.<br />
She finished eating her packet of Doritos and drinking her Coca-cola can.<br />
It was really good to hear the birds singing and the sound of the water flowing in the river.<br />
She laid on the ground, looking at the sky and the clouds while listening to some good ambient music.<br />
Thinking about her life, about Littletato, Vitória, Yam, other friends that she had.<br />
Julia was smiling, she was calm and reflective, looking at the clouds moving, feeling the breeze.<br />
Feeling the weight of her body, and feeling all of her problems going away.<br />
She closed her eyes and began to sleep, listening to the song, and feeling nature.<br />
<br />
Julia woke up and noticed that the music has ended, she got up and locked the screen of her phone, storing the earphones and her smartphone inside her backpack.<br />
She grabbed the shopping bag and put the empty Doritos packet and the empty can of Coca-cola inside it.<br />
Then she walked to a near trash bin and dropped the bag inside it.<br />
Julia walked close to her bicycle and unlocked it, then she started to ride back home.<br />
She stopped and grabbed her phone from the backpack, looking at the hours.<br />
It was eleven o'clock in the morning, she stored her phone inside the backpack again and continued to ride back home.<br />
<br />
She decided to grab her phone again a put to play a good song of the folk genre on it to listen to while she traveled back home.<br />
Julia started riding her bike again while looking at the scenario and nature, the trees and grass, the beautiful sun, the girl loved nature.<br />
She arrived home and unlocked the house, storing her bicycle inside it.<br />
Then she locked the front door and left the bicycle's key on the key holder of the house.<br />
She walked to the kitchen, drank a whole bottle of water, and ate an apple, she was a little tired.<br />
Julia walked to the living room and laid on the couch, turning on the television.<br />
She closed her eyes and slept on the warm noon, waiting for Littletato to come from work.

		It was a Friday, Littletato was dreaming of cookies, she ate a lot of them.<br />
She asked herself why she always had food dreams, maybe it is because she loved eating stuff.<br />
Littletato was eating cookies, she was sat on a throne, looking at a pile of gold.<br />
She thought that she was a queen or a princess, some royal person.<br />
There was a giant pile of cookies in front of her, she could eat every cookie.<br />
Littletato was wearing a wool coat, it was a stylish thing to wear.<br />
She was known as "The queen of eating" or "The queen of the cookies" because she ate and produced a lot of cookies.<br />
Littletato could press a button and it would make cookies for her.<br />
There were also grandmothers, farms, mines, factories, and portals that produced cookies for her.<br />
Her cookie factory was known everywhere in the world, she was very famous for making cookies.<br />
The TV news was flooded with the news about her and her cookie factory, she was a very good cookie maker.<br />
After some years, cookies became the new currency and people threw the old paper money away.<br />
<br />
Then another dream came in, Littletato was driving on a highway with a car that had some purple neon on its sides.<br />
The car's radio was playing a track of the Synth wave genre, Littletato liked to feel the wind on her hair, she liked to listen to the song while driving on the highway.<br />
There were a lot of people on the highway too, driving their cars, Littletato looked at her car and thought that it was a Delorean.<br />
A fast car passed by her, it was a car with red neon on its sides, it looked like a car from a rebel group that tried to fight for freedom in the city where Littletato was.<br />
That group fought for freedom and freedom of speech, they did not agree with the city's governor's choice of monitoring the population.<br />
Littletato stepped on the car's accelerator and came face to face with the person inside the red neon car.<br />
The person lowered the car window, it was a girl that had red LEDs on her hair, she looked punk, and had purple eye makeup on her eyes.<br />
"Hey, you're new here, right? Wanna join our group?" asked the girl.<br />
"What your group is about?" asked Littletato.<br />
"We fight for freedom and fight to deactivate the surveillance system that exists in the city, the governor created it to monitor people's life.<br />
We don't want that, we want freedom and privacy, we have good hackers on our side," said her.<br />
"Oh, that sounds cool, what is your name?" asked Littletato while driving fast, following the red neon car.<br />
"My name is Mika, what's yours?" asked the red LED girl.<br />
"Littletato, nice to meet you Mika," said Littletato.<br />
"Nice to meet you too, Littletato," said Mika, smiling.<br />
Then Littletato drove together with Mika, they arrived at the headquarters of "The Underdogs", the rebel group of Mika.<br />
<br />
After that, the dream switched to another dream, Littletato was feeling very calm inside that dream, she felt happy and relaxed.<br />
She was seeing a beautiful castle of glass, it was transparent and you could see the things inside it, it was really beautiful.<br />
Behind the castle of glass was a wonderful blue sky and some white clouds, it was like Littletato was high in the sky, close to the clouds.<br />
Littletato could look at the sun and see it paint the clouds yellow, see it pass through the clouds.<br />
The castle of glass was empty, but Littletato did not felt lonely or sad, she was happy for being in such a good and relaxing place.<br />
It was like the castle was traveling on top of the clouds, that the clouds were holding it.<br />
Littletato could fly in the sky even if she had no wings, she began flying close to the castle and landed close to its door.<br />
Its door was big and tall, Littletato pushed the door and it opened, she started walking inside the castle.<br />
The castle of glass had various beautiful chandeliers with a lot of colorful jewels hanging on them.<br />
Littletato thought that it was very beautiful, seeing all those amazing chandeliers with red, pink, purple, white, black, blue, green, yellow, and grey jewels hanging on them.<br />
She could see the sunlight coming inside the castle of glass and forming a rainbow inside it.<br />
Her eyes shone with amazement and astonishment, Littletato was in a very beautiful place.<br />
The castle of glass was really big, she began walking inside it and opening all of its doors, she saw a library, a room with a bed and a wardrobe.<br />
And a dining room with a really wide table, the table was filled with slices of lemon cake on the plates and had bottles of Coca-cola close to a big cake that was on the end of the table.<br />
Littletato thought that there was a party going on there, even if there was no one nearby, she sat at a chair.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a purple alicorn pony appeared there in the dining room, she said that her name was Twilight Sparkle, and was surprised to see a human for the first time.<br />
(There goes me again inserting "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" in my stories xD.<br />
I love MLP: FIM, I can't help but put it in other things I love, which are my stories :3.)<br />
"Hello there, where do you come from?" asked Twilight Sparkle while looking at Littletato.<br />
Littletato was surprised at the sight of the little pony, she never saw a pony or an alicorn before, she looked at her wings and her horn.<br />
"Some minutes ago I just realized that I was floating in the sky close to a castle of glass, I could fly, so I began flying towards that castle.<br />
And I began exploring this castle and opening its doors, the chandeliers here are so beautiful.<br />
I already love this place even if I haven't spent much time in here," said Littletato while looking at the ceiling of the castle.<br />
"Oh, that's interesting, this castle floats high in the sky, so it is really hard for people to visit it or even know that it is real.<br />
So I don't know how you got in here, but... You can stay here if you want... By the way, what is your name?" asked Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"My name is Littletato, what is yours?" asked Littletato smiling lightly while looking at Twilight.<br />
"My name is Twilight Sparkle, so, you can fly right?" asked Twilight.<br />
"Yeah, I guess, can I show you?" asked Littletato, getting up from the chair.<br />
"Yes, please," said Twilight Sparkle.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato began floating towards the ceiling of the dining room like she was floating on the water.<br />
Twilight Sparkle was surprised by that, she used her magic to get Littletato on the floor again, her horn shone in purple.<br />
"My friends are gonna come here for a birthday party, do you wanna join us Littletato?" asked Twilight Sparkle, smiling at Littletato.<br />
"Of course!" said Littletato smiling, "Whose birthday is it?" asked her.<br />
"It's Dashie's birthday, Rainbow Dash, my friend," said Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Oh, can she create rainbows?" asked Littletato with her eyes shining with amazement.<br />
"Well... Yeah, I guess, when she flies fast she creates a sonic rainbow which is kind of like flying faster than the speed of light, then a rainbow appears behind her," said Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Wow, that's awesome," said Littletato putting her hands on her cheeks and smiling.<br />
"That's what she would say if she saw something awesome," said Twilight Sparkle while giggling a little.<br />
"So, I'm gonna read a book for thirty minutes to wait for my friends to arrive here okay?" asked Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Okay, can I sleep in here?" asked Littletato while looking at Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Of course, hehe, I think you're a good person.<br />
In fact, the first time I saw you here today I thought you were an alien," said Twilight Sparkle while giggling a little.<br />
"But I read in a book about the legend of the humans, creatures that were bipeds, creatures that walked on two legs and held things with their hands.<br />
So I was not so surprised of seeing you, I thought 'Oh, I finally saw a human in my life, they say that they are rare'," said Twilight Sparkle while smiling and looking at Littletato.<br />
<br />
"Come with me, I'm gonna show you your room, I always have a free room for guests," said Twilight Sparkle who began trotting to the stairs.<br />
Littletato followed her and they arrived at a door, Twilight opened the door and Littletato saw a room with a bed, wardrobe, and a writing desk.<br />
The girl entered the room and began walking inside it to familiarize herself with the room.<br />
"This is your room, have fun," said Twilight while smiling.<br />
"Oh, and another thing, the castle is not made of glass, it's just a spell that I use to keep ponies away from here and prevent pegasus from hitting the castle accidentally," said Twilight, who made her horn glow and turned on the colors of the castle.<br />
The castle was now opaque and you could see that it was made of crystals, Twilight Sparkle said to Littletato that a crystal tree was planted on the ground down there.<br />
Twilight Sparkle said that the tree grew and generated a crystal castle, that castle began flying and stopped flying when it reached the sky.<br />
And now they have a beautiful crystal castle to live inside and house all of their friends and stuff.<br />
<br />
Spike, the purple baby dragon assistant, and friend of Twilight Sparkle arrived, he walked upstairs while looking for Twilight.<br />
"Twilight? Twilight? Where are you?" asked him.<br />
"I'm up here Spike, at the guest's room," said Twilight Sparkle.<br />
Then Spike walked there and saw Littletato.<br />
"Who is she?" asked Spike.<br />
"She is my new friend, Littletato, she said that she just appeared close to the castle and she thought that it was a castle of glass.<br />
Then she began exploring the castle and looking at it, she is gonna stay here with us Spike," said Twilight Sparkle smiling.<br />
"Oh, okay, nice to meet you, Littletato," said Spike, walking close to Littletato and shaking her hand.<br />
Littletato shook the hand of Spike back and smiled, "Nice to meet you too, Spike".<br />
"Okay, I'm gonna read my comic book Twilight, tell me when the others arrive," said Spike, going downstairs and walking inside the library.<br />
"Okay Spike," said Twilight Sparkle before he left the room.<br />
"I'll tell you too when the girls arrive okay?" asked Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Okay, thanks Twilight," said Littletato smiling.<br />
"No problem, hehe," said Twilight Sparkle, who closed the door, trotted downstairs, and entered inside the library, getting a book with her horn magic and laying on the ground.<br />
<br />
Littletato laid on her bed and looked at the ceiling, smiling happily while feeling her current feelings and thinking about where she is right now.<br />
She thought that she was experiencing a lot of new things, new feelings.<br />
Littletato met new people, she met a purple pony alicorn who had wings, a horn, and magic.<br />
The girl closed her eyes, after some minutes she began sleeping, she woke up in yet another dream.<br />
Littletato woke up and smiled while remembering and thinking about the dreams she had.<br />
The dream about how she was a cookie producer and had a cookie company that dominated the world and made cookies the new currency.<br />
That dream of Synthwave stuff and the rebel group of Mika.<br />
And that awesome dream about the castle of glass that was not made of glass and there were a purple pony and a purple dragon inside and a birthday party was going to happen.<br />
Littletato thought about those three dreams, she wondered how her mind could create those dreams even if she did not know those people and those places.<br />
She thought that she was really traveling to those places when she dreamt, like astral projection.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 23/08/2018.<br />
I revised this chapter on 08/12/2020 while listening to my Future Bass playlist on YouTube.<br />
<br />
It was really good, I was really happy like I am every time that I write Littletato or other stories of mine.<br />
I also drank water while writing and revising this chapter uwu.<br />
Thank you for reading :3.<br />
<br />
Things that I wrote when I wrote a lot of stuff and I wanted to finish the chapter but these things down here would not be good for putting on the end of the chapter because they would start a new block of text, maybe in another chapter:<br />
<br />
Littletato then walked outside her room and turned off the light, she walked downstairs and entered the library.<br />
"Hey Twilight, I'm a little hungry, and the girls haven't arrived yet, can I eat something other than the cake?" asked Littletato, caressing her belly with her hand.<br />
"Of course, there is some bread in the kitchen, and some hayburguers, I don't know if you like that, since you're a human.<br />
But you can use the Food Generator that Izaque gave me, Izaque is a human too, he said that he was a New Worlder, a person that lived inside a New World universe.<br />
He said that the Food Generator was just a Thing Generator but configured to generate only edible stuff, so... Have fun," said Twilight Sparkle, smiling happily while wagging her tail.<br />
"Okay, thanks a lot Twilight," said Littletato smiling.<br />
"No problem Littletato, hehe," said Twilight Sparkle.<br />
Then Littletato started walking to the kitchen, she opened the fridge and grabbed a pack of milk.<br />
After that, Littletato closed the fridge and looked at the kitchen sink, there was a black cube there, maybe that was the Food Generator that Twilight talked about.)

		It was a Friday, before midnight, Littletato was dreaming, she was very calm inside her current dream, she felt happy and relaxed.<br />
She was seeing a beautiful castle of glass, it was transparent and you could see the things inside it, it was really beautiful.<br />
Behind the castle of glass was a wonderful blue sky and some white clouds, it was like Littletato was high in the sky, close to the clouds.<br />
Some minutes passed inside her dream, a lot of things happened, she was talking with an alicorn pony called Twilight Sparkle.<br />
The castle was not made of glass, it was opaque and Twilight Sparkle could use her horn magic to change the castle between its two modes, glass and opaque.<br />
Littletato met spike, the purple baby dragon assistant of Twilight Sparkle, he could spit fire through his mouth.<br />
Julia was dreaming about a castle, she is sat on a very wide table, the part where she was sat had a big bowl of pink cupcakes.<br />
The rest of the table was filled with a mixture of sweet and savory, pies, cakes, coxinha, pastry, and other foods.<br />
She ate a cupcake, the taste of the cupcake reminded her of Pinkie Pie, a pink earth pony from My Little Pony who had a dark pink mane.<br />
Then a bed fell from the ceiling and landed on the ground close to Julia.<br />
She got up and laid on the bed, then Julia noticed that a small fridge was there, on the other side of the room.<br />
Julia got up from the bed and walked close to the fridge, opening it and grabbing a can of Coca-cola.<br />
<br />
The girl looked at the door, it was a tall door, it was made of wood, dark wood just like the walls.<br />
The house looked like an old house from inside, a house of rich people.<br />
There were two big windows on the right of Julia, she looked at them, they had beautiful white curtains.<br />
There was a light outside of the windows, a bright white light that did not let Julia see past the windows.<br />
Julia looked at the door again, the door opened, Pinkie Pie was behind the door, opening it.<br />
Pinkie Pie flew around the dining room even if she could not fly, yelling "Weeeeeeeeeee!"<br />
"Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie, and I threw this party just for you!" said Pinkie Pie, holding Julia's hands with her hoofs.<br />
"Do you like the food?" asked Pinkie Pie, smiling.<br />
"Yes, it is pretty good, I ate only one cupcake actually, I know you from a cartoon called My Little Pony," said Julia, smiling at her.<br />
"You only ate one cupcake?!" asked Pinkie Pie yelling, surprised, "I don't know what is a 'cartoon', what is it?" asked Pinkie Pie, curious.<br />
"Oh, it is... nothing, I know you from somewhere else than here, anyway, why you threw this party for me Pinkie Pie?" asked Julia.<br />
"Because you're a good person, I know you, Julia, and you're a caring person and good friend to me, you always help me," said Pinkie Pie, hugging Julia tight.<br />
"Oh, thanks Pinkie Pie, I'm really happy that you think that," said Julia, returning the hug while smiling.<br />
"But... I never met Pinkie Pie, how she is my friend?" thought Julia, curious.<br />
"Anyway, are you gonna eat the food?" asked Pinkie Pie, breaking out from the hug while looking at the table and looking back at Julia.<br />
"Yes, do you wanna eat with me? I don't think I can handle all that food," asked Julia while giggling a little.<br />
"Yes, hehe, yay!" said Pinkie Pie, jumping happily on top of a chair and starting to eat some pies.<br />
Julia made the same, they started to eat together, the food was very delicious.<br />
<br />
Then, after some time eating, Pinkie Pie and Julia finished eating all of the food.<br />
"I'm gonna get some rest Julia, my tummy hurts from so much food," said Pinkie Pie with her hoof on her belly.<br />
"If you need me I'm gonna be in my room upstairs okay?" said Pinkie Pie, starting to walking to the door, closing it, and walking upstairs.<br />
"Okay Pinkie Pie," said Julia before Pinkie Pie left the dining room.<br />
Then Julia walked to the small fridge, the letters "TPF" were written on the door of the fridge.<br />
Julia grabbed a can of Coca-cola out of the fridge and started drinking it to relieve the pain in her tummy.<br />
She finished drinking the can and threw it inside the trash can that was there.<br />
After that, Julia laid on the bed looking at the beautiful chandelier that was on the ceiling.<br />
She felt a little tired, Julia closed her eyes and started to sleep.<br />
<br />
After some minutes, Julia still had her eyes closed, she heard a familiar voice calling her.<br />
"Julia... wake up, wake up... Hey, Julia, wake up," said the voice.<br />
Julia opened her eyes and everything was blurry, she started to see well again, she saw the same room with dark wood walls.<br />
In front of her was Littletato, telling her to wake up, and that the breakfast is ready.<br />
After that, she heard Littletato's voice more realistically.<br />
Julia opened her eyes again, she woke up, it was not a dream anymore, her brain used the real voice of Littletato to create a dream.<br />
After some seconds, Julia got up and hugged Littletato, Littletato kissed Julia's lips and smiled, it was a Saturday.<br />
"I had a dream with Pinkie Pie, and after some minutes in that dream, I heard your voice call me to wake up cause breakfast was ready hon," said Julia.<br />
"Oh, I think your brain used my voice as a dream 'fuel', my brain does that sometimes, it's good that I can wake you up more easily," said Littletato while giggling a little.<br />
"Hehe, I love you hon," said Julia, kissing Littletato's lips.<br />
"I love you too my little potato," said Littletato, kissing Julia's lips back.<br />
Then Julia got up and walked to the bathroom, she started making her morning needs.<br />
<br />
Then the couple walked to the kitchen and started to eat breakfast, Littletato had made eggs with bacon.<br />
"Hey honey, today I dreamed about cookies, and a cookie factory, also about Twilight Sparkle and her crystal castle, it was very good," said Littletato while eating.<br />
"Oh, that sounds interesting hon, I dreamed with Pinkie Pie today, she is my favorite character of My Little Pony," said Júlia smiling, remembering the dream.<br />
"How was that dream hon?" asked Littletato, curious.<br />
"I noticed that I was sitting on the chair of a wide table, it had a lot of pink cupcakes and other foods, sweet and savory.<br />
Then I ate one cupcake, suddenly a bed fell from the ceiling and landed next to me, that was normal for me.<br />
There was a fridge on the other side of the room, I got up and walked close to it, opening it and grabbing a can of Coca-cola.<br />
Then Pinkie Pie appeared there and said that she made that party just for me, I was happy for her to be there, it was good to know her.<br />
The food was too much, I invited her to eat with me, she accepted and we ate a lot, our tummies hurt.<br />
Then I laid on the bed and slept, then I woke up in the dream and after that, in real life," explained Julia while looking at Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that's very interesting honey, it was a really good dream," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Julia.<br />
Then the couple finished eating, they walked to the living room to watch a movie.<br />
Littletato heard that a new movie was out on the Vegeflix app, the couple sat on the couch and Littletato turned on the Smart TV.<br />
After that, Littletato searched for the movie "The Vegengers: Infinite Vegetablewar" at Vegeflix.<br />
"My sister said that this movie is very good," said Julia, looking at Littletato.<br />
"Oh, let's watch it then hon, do you want to post a picture of us and the movie on the Vegesapp status?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, let's do it hon," said Julia smiling.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato pressed play on the movie and grabbed her smartphone, she paused the movie and took a selfie of her, Julia, and the TV.<br />
Littletato posted that picture on her Vegesapp status, she sent the photo to Julia so she could post it on her status too.<br />
Julia posted the photo on her status, Vitória sent her a message on Vegesapp, she said that she is having fun with her boyfriend in New York.<br />
After that, Julia replied to Vitória with some happy face emojis, Vitória said "Good movie sis!" to Julia.<br />
"Thanks, sis! ^^" replied Julia, Julia said that she is having fun with Littletato.<br />
Vitória said that she is happy for Julia, Julia is also happy for her sister.<br />
Littletato asked who it was, Julia said it was her sister, saying that Vitória was having fun with her boyfriend in New York.<br />
Then Littletato hugged Julia tight and kissed her lips, smiling.<br />
After that, Littletato grabbed her smartphone, she sent a message to Carol, her sister, on Vegesapp, asking what she was doing on Saturday.<br />
Carol had blond hair, she said that she was just playing some Countable Vegestrike 1.6 and streaming it on Vegewitch.<br />
Littletato said that it was very interesting, she asked for the Livestream link so she could watch it after watching the movie.<br />
Carol sent the link of the stream to Littletato, Littletato said thanks with some happy face emojis, and said "Good game sis!"<br />
Then Carol asked what Littletato was doing on Saturday.<br />
Littletato said that she was watching a Marvel movie with her girlfriend Julia.<br />
"What movie are you watching sis?" asked Carol.<br />
"I'm watching 'The Vegengers: Infinite Vegetablewar'," replied Littletato.<br />
"That's good, I still didn't watch it, I'm going to watch it after I finish my Livestream, good movie sis!" said Carol with some happy face emojis.<br />
"Thanks, sis, hehe ^^," replied Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato pressed play and relaxed on the couch, starting to watch the movie, the Marvel intro appeared on the screen.<br />
<br />
The movie showed the Marvel logo, starting, it showed the spaceship of Vegethor in space.<br />
A lot of Vegesgardians were dead on the spaceship, Vegebony Maw was walking among the corpses.<br />
Vegeheimdall was badly wounded, he reached out trying to stop Vegebony Maw as he passed, but he lacks the strength.<br />
Vegebony Maw stepped over the corpses with no mind as he spoke, as if they were scattered pieces of dirty clothing on a bedroom floor.<br />
"Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan... You may think this is suffering... no. It is salvation.<br />
Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile..." said Vegebony Maw, Corvus Glaive stabbed one of the lingering Vegesgardians, "For even in death, you have become Children of VegeThanos," continued Vegebony Maw.<br />
Loki stayed with the Black Order. He watched VegeThanos, shrouded in darkness and light, a vague silhouette.<br />
Some hours passed, the movie ended, Julia and Littletato loved the movie.<br />
They were sad because of all the people that died at the hands of VegeThanos, just for universe balance, they wanted them to be revived.<br />
Julia was sad because of Vegeter Parker that died, turning into ashes, Littletato was sad because of Mantis who turned into ashes.<br />
Littletato hugged Julia tight and kissed her lips, the movie was marked as "Watched" in Littletato's profile of the Vegeflix app.<br />
The couple was tired, Littletato turned off the TV and they both walked to the bedroom.<br />
Julia and Littletato laid on the bed, Littletato covered her and Júlia with the blanket, they closed their eyes and slept in the cold night, hugging tight.<br />

		It was a Sunday, in the year 2018, Littletato was working on her job on New Year's Eve, she could leave work early this day because of the New Year's Eve.<br />
Littletato then grabbed her things and said happy new year to her coworker Mia.<br />
She also stopped by her boss' room and wished a happy new year to her boss.<br />
After that, Littletato left the building, it was a cold day in San Francisco, there was water all around the roads.<br />
It was six in the afternoon.<br />
Littletato was using her dark brown coat, she had an umbrella inside her purse if she needed it.<br />
The girl started walking to her house, she was walking on the sidewalk.<br />
It started raining, Littletato opened her purse and grabbed her umbrella, she untied it and opened it.<br />
Then Littletato grabbed her smartphone from out of her purse and sent a message to Julia saying that she was going to be a little late because she was going to stop at the supermarket.<br />
Julia replied saying okay, Littletato stored her smartphone in her purse again and started walking to the supermarket.<br />
She arrived there and picked up a plastic basket and grabbed a Doritos pack, a bottle of 3,5 liters of Coca-cola, and a packet of chocolate stuffed biscuits.<br />
Then Littletato started walking to the supermarket cashier, she paid for the purchase and left the supermarket.<br />
After that, the girl continued walking home.<br />
<br />
She arrived at her house's door, grabbing the house's key from her pocket and opening it.<br />
Littletato entered the house and Julia hugged her, saying "Welcome home (okaeri), honey," while smiling.<br />
Then Littletato kissed Julia's lips, "I'm back, honey," then she walked to the kitchen and left the plastic bags with the food on top of the table.<br />
Julia started opening the plastic bags and taking the things off them.<br />
"Oh, honey, you brought Doritos, I love them, for us to pass our New Year's Eve right?" asked Julia, smiling while holding the Doritos packet.<br />
"Yes hon, I love it too, I also bought a big bottle of Coca-cola and a packet of chocolate stuffed biscuits," said Littletato, removing the Coca-cola bottle and the chocolate stuffed biscuits from the bags.<br />
Then Littletato placed the bottle of Coca-cola inside the fridge for it to get cold.<br />
She stored the Doritos packet and the chocolate stuffed biscuits packet inside the kitchen cabinet.<br />
"Let's prepare ourselves for New Year's Eve hon?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes hon, let's do it," replied Julia.<br />
Then the couple walked to the bedroom and changed themselves, using white clothes for New Year's Eve.<br />
"I heard that there is going to be a big screen with the countdown to the new year downtown on New Year's Eve," said Julia.<br />
"Oh, that sounds good, let's watch a little movie and we're going there at eleven pm okay?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay hon," replied Julia.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato and Julia walked to the living room, they sat on the couch.<br />
Littletato grabbed the TV controller and turned the TV on.<br />
She started looking at the catalog of Vegeflix looking for a movie to watch.<br />
(Vegeflix is a website and mobile app where you can watch series, movies, cartoons, and animes online, using a paid plan.)<br />
Julia grabbed her smartphone and started sending messages to her friends wishing them a happy new year.<br />
She sent messages to her sister Vitória, to Littletato's sister Carol, to Yam, and her mother and father.<br />
They all replied, wishing Julia a happy new year, Julia also posted in her Vegesapp status wishing a happy new year to all of their contacts.<br />
(Vegesapp is an app that you can install on your smartphone, it lets you chat with people, you need a phone number and a SIM card to use it.)<br />
Littletato chose a movie for them to watch, it was called "The Vegengers: Vegend Game", it was a new superhero movie that launched recently.<br />
Then Littletato grabbed her smartphone, she posted on her Vegesapp status wishing a happy new year to everyone.<br />
After that, the girl sent messages to all of her friends wishing them a happy new year.<br />
She said happy new year to Julia's sister Vitória, to her sister Carol, Yam, her coworker Mia, and her father and mother.<br />
Then Littletato walked to the kitchen, grabbed Julia's water bottle, and walked to the living room, leaving it on top of the living room table at the right of the right arm of the couch.<br />
After that, Littletato kissed Julia's lips and smiled, she walked to the kitchen and grabbed a bowl, opening the Doritos packet and throwing all of the Doritos inside the bowl.<br />
Littletato asked from the kitchen if Julia wanted her to mix the Doritos and the chocolate stuffed biscuits on the bowl.<br />
Julia replied saying yes, then Littletato opened the packet of biscuits and threw all of them inside the bowl.<br />
<br />
Littletato had a Styrofoam box, she placed a lot of ice cubes inside it, then she grabbed two cups made of glass.<br />
Then the girl grabbed the bottle of Coca-cola from inside the fridge's freezer and filled the two cups with Coca-cola.<br />
After that, Littletato walked to the living room, leaving the cup of Julia next to her on the table at the right of the couch.<br />
She left her cup on the left table that was on the left part of the couch.<br />
Then Littletato placed the Coca-cola bottle inside the Styrofoam box filled with ice cubes so it does not get hot.<br />
Littletato walked to the kitchen and grabbed the bowl, she turned the lights off and walked back to the living room.<br />
After that, Littletato left the bowl of Doritos and chocolate stuffed biscuits between her and Julia.<br />
Littletato grabbed the TV's controller and unpaused the movie, Julia posted on her Vegesapp status saying that she was going to watch a movie with Littletato before New Year's Eve.<br />
Then Julia blocked her smartphone's screen, she kissed Littletato's lips and smiled.<br />
The movie logo appeared, it was the Marvel Studios logo, the same company that made the "Vegeider-Tableman: Far From San Francisco" movie.<br />
Julia grabbed some Doritos from the bowl and ate them, then she took a sip of her Coca-cola cup.<br />
Littletato grabbed one Doritos and one chocolate stuffed biscuit from the bowl, she ate both of them and took a sip of her Coca-cola cup.<br />
They continued watching the movie, the couple wanted to see the dead characters alive again, they were sad because they were gone.<br />
At the half of the movie, there was half of the Doritos, half of the chocolate stuffed biscuits, and half of the Coca-cola bottle of 3,5 liters.<br />
<br />
After watching for three hours, the movie ended, the food ended too, there was still some Coca-cola left in the bottle.<br />
Littletato grabbed the bowl and brought it to the kitchen, she left it below the sink's tap and opened the tap.<br />
Then she closed the tap and walked to the living room, sitting on the couch, Julia grabbed the two cups and left them on top of the sink.<br />
Julia then came back to the living room, "Wanna end the rest, honey?" asked Littletato looking at the Coca-cola bottle.<br />
"Yes," replied Julia grabbing the Coca-cola bottle and drinking from the beak.<br />
Then they got ready for New Year's Eve, it was eleven and fifty o'clock at night.<br />
Julia left the bottle of Coca-cola in the kitchen to put it in recycling the day after.<br />
Littletato turned the TV off, the movie they watched was registered on the Watch History of Littletato's Vegeflix account.<br />
The couple locked the house and started walking downtown to see the New Year's clock.<br />
Both of them looked at the beautiful scenery, the trees, and the lights of the city of San Francisco.<br />
There were a lot of people walking towards downtown to see the New Year Countdown.<br />
<br />
After some minutes of walking, the couple arrived downtown.<br />
A big crowd was there, the people were looking high at the big screen that was installed on a famous building in the city.<br />
There were still eight minutes left to the New Year, the people watched the minutes pass on the digital display.<br />
A lot of couples hugged tight and kissed, a lot of families hugged themselves.<br />
It was a moment of happiness for everyone, everyone was in the spirit of Reveillon, making wishes for the New Year.<br />
There were still five minutes left to the New Year, the people were looking at the big and high screen on the building.<br />
Littletato thought about what she did this year after she met Julia and her life changed.<br />
She thought about the friends that she made during this year after she moved to San Francisco and before.<br />
About her first interview in San Francisco, she was happy thinking that she got a job at the Interworks Technologies company.<br />
The girl thought about when she first met Julia at that coffee shop when she declared her love for Julia (chapter 1).<br />
When she met her coworker, Littletato thought that she was kind and gentle (chapter 2).<br />
That day that she bought the house, she was so happy that day, owning a house along with Julia (chapter 1).<br />
Her various days going to work walking while listening to her folk playlist on the Vegetify app on her smartphone.<br />
When Littletato met Julia's sister, Vitória, she was a designer, and a very interesting person (chapter 4).<br />
That day when Littletato taught Julia to draw in the Paint Tool SAI program on her computer (chapter 5).<br />
The dream she had about being a space traveler along with Julia (chapter 5).<br />
When Littletato went to that park on Saturday and Yam appeared there, Littletato presented him to Julia, and then they went to the supermarket and bought a bottle of Coca-cola (chapter 6).<br />
The Sunday when they played a lot of games in the Vegebox videogame that Littletato had, they played Vegetablefall 2 (chapter 7).<br />
That Monday when she watched Captain Vegerica: Vegetable War with Julia while eating Doritos and drinking Coca-cola, it was very cool (chapter 8).<br />
Her farm and rain dream, drinking a can of Coca-cola outside the old house, it started raining and she entered the house, wore some light clothes, and slept (chapter 9).<br />
The allegoric dream with the Mexican man singing, the boy playing his electric guitar like a Dubstep bass, the gray-haired girl with the fridge, and the boy writing a story on his computer about a grape (chapter 10).<br />
That dream she had about going on a trip to Texas with Julia, she woke up and did a lot of things, she watched an episode of Atypical with Julia (chapter 11).<br />
When Littletato had a cookie factory and a cyberpunk dream, a dream about a cookie factory, and when she dreamt of that Castle of Glass and Twilight Sparkle (chapter 12).<br />
That day when she watched The Vegengers: Infinite Vegetablewar with Julia, she posted the movie on her Vegesapp status (chapter 13).<br />
Thirty seconds were remaining for the New Year, the crowd counted together.<br />
Everyone shouting together, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.<br />
There were fireworks on the big screen and real fireworks too, everyone shouted "Happy New Year! Happy 2019!"<br />
Everyone was happy and smiling, looking at their relatives, their partners.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 01/01/2019.<br />
Finished revising it on 14/01/2021.<br />
<br />
It was really good to revise it while listening to the Yuru Camp anime soundtrack and an Indie Folk music mix.<br />
This chapter has a lot of references to previous reviewed chapters of The Life of Littletato.<br />
I loved revising this chapter, it was really good.<br />
I'm so happy about this chapter, what a way to end the year of 2018 &colon;3 😊.<br />
A lot of good memories about the older chapters of Littletato.<br />
Thank you so much for reading! And thank you for reading Littletato for all the year of 2018.<br />

		It was Monday, it was a little cold, Littletato woke up, she got to work today.<br />
Littletato thought about last night, it was Sunday, day 31 of December 2018, she was happy, watching that superhero movie with Julia while eating Doritos and drinking Coca-cola.<br />
And also thinking of what she did in 2018, the friends she made, Mia, Yam, Vitória, and others.<br />
Littletato had these thoughts on her mind while she was in bed, looking at the ceiling, it was five and forty AM.<br />
The sun was beginning to shine through the curtains, Littletato stretched, hugging Julia and kissing her lips.<br />
After that, Littletato got up, did her morning needs, and walked to the kitchen.<br />
Littletato grabbed two plates and placed them on top of the kitchen table, she grabbed the bread sack and opened it.<br />
Placing two slices on each plate, then she closed the bread sack and stored it inside the kitchen cabinet.<br />
After that, the girl walked to the fridge and opened it, she thought about that TPF fridge ad that she saw one day on TV.<br />
She grabbed the cheese and milk, after that, she walked to the kitchen table and placed both the milk and cheese on top of it.<br />
Then she walked to the kitchen sink and grabbed a knife and two cups made of glass.<br />
Littletato placed both the cups on top of the table, then she grabbed a spoon and placed it inside one of the cups.<br />
She cut two slices of cheese for each bread, then she placed two slices on each bread and closed them.<br />
The girl grabbed the spoon and left it on top of the table, she filled the two cups with milk.<br />
After that, Littletato grabbed the chocolate powder packet from the cabinet and put some chocolate powder on each cup.<br />
She mixed the chocolate powder on the two cups with the help of the spoon.<br />
Then Littletato walked to the bedroom, she woke up Julia with a kiss on her lips.<br />
Julia got up and did her morning necessities, then the couple walked to the kitchen and sat at the table to eat breakfast.<br />
<br />
They both eat breakfast, Julia said that it was delicious, Littletato said thanks while smiling.<br />
Littletato thought about the rain, how it felt, the sound that it made, she liked the rain, she liked to hear the raindrops hit the roof of her house, she liked thunder too.<br />
The girl got up, she placed the plates and the cups on top of the sink, after that, she walked to the bedroom.<br />
She started preparing herself to go to work, Julia was there with her.<br />
"Hey, honey, what do you think about living with Yam, Mia, Carol, and Vitória?" asked Julia, curious.<br />
"What do you mean honey?" asked Littletato, sitting on the bed, putting on her socks and shoes.<br />
"Hmm... It is a dream of mine, to have a big house, and to live with all our friends, and my sister, what do you think of that, hon?" asked Julia, who was sitting at the side of Littletato.<br />
"I think it is a good dream hon, I wanted to live with my sister too, maybe when we have a lot of money and I have a higher rank at my work," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that's good honey, hehe, I think I'm gonna start working too then, and storing my money on the bank," said Julia, kissing Littletato's cheek while smiling.<br />
"Okay, hehe," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
Then Littletato got up, she walked to the front door of the house, opening it.<br />
Julia hugged her and kissed her lips, "I'm gonna bring the key to the house okay hon? In case you want to go out for something," asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay, hon, don't worry, I have the spare key," replied Julia.<br />
Then Littletato got out of the house and started walking to work.<br />
<br />
Julia locked the front door of the house and walked to the kitchen.<br />
The kitchen of Littletato's house was on the right of the living room, there was a little room where they had their computers.<br />
After looking through the window to see the weather, Julia opened the fridge, she grabbed her bottle of water and drank a little of it.<br />
Then Julia placed the bottle inside the fridge and closed it.<br />
Julia walked to the bedroom, her smartphone was charging on the socket that existed on the wall, her smartphone was on the floor.<br />
She threw herself on the bed and looked at the ceiling, she sighed and thought about how she was feeling right now.<br />
Julia always spends her day inside the house while Littletato works.<br />
The girl has some money in her bank account, she can help Littletato with the bills if she needs it.<br />
But the salary of Littletato is enough so she can pay the bills, buy food, and store the rest in her bank account.<br />
So Julia can spend her day laid on the bed, doing nothing all day, but today she is not feeling like doing anything.<br />
Julia yawned and turned to the left side of the bed, looking at the open window, she could see the yard of the house, there were some trees there.<br />
The girl stretched herself and got out of bed, walking to the computer room, the room where the computer of Littletato and the laptop of Julia stayed.<br />
After that, she sat on the chair of Littletato's computer, she could use her computer, Julia had a computer account just for her.<br />
Julia turned the computer on, it was very fast to boot, she logged in using her account.<br />
The girl looked at the hours on the right bottom corner of the screen, it was 7:30 AM, Littletato was probably working by now.<br />
<br />
Julia wanted to find a job in San Francisco, she heard that there were a lot of jobs there.<br />
The girl opened the Mozilla Vegefox web browser and opened some job websites.<br />
She found a lot of jobs, the girl created an account on that website, she started signing up for a lot of jobs.<br />
Julia inserted her phone number on the website.<br />
If she was applied for a job interview, they would send her a message on Vegesapp.<br />
Julia signed up for a total of fifty jobs, she was very happy and excited.<br />
Then she closed the tabs and closed Mozilla Vegefox too, she opened a game to play.<br />
The game was called "Project Zomboid", it was a zombie and survival game, Julia liked it a lot, the feeling of loneliness that it caused her.<br />
She liked those types of games, the ones that make you feel immersed inside the universe of the game, and that cause you an emotion.<br />
Julia clicked on the continue button to load her latest save game, she was controlling a character called Anna Thompson, who had fifteen-seven years old.<br />
The girl was inside her house, she killed a lot of zombies around the outside of her house with her fireman ax.<br />
So she did not need to worry about zombies knocking on her door.<br />
Her house was all barricaded with planks on the windows, no zombie could see her from outside.<br />
She had plant seeds, a compost crate, a rain collector barrel with a garbage bag inside it.<br />
The girl was training her carpentry skills, she dismantled chairs and tables to gain more experience.<br />
Julia loved to play that game, it felt like she was living on the zombie apocalypse.<br />
<br />
After playing for some hours, Julia was a little tired, she stretched back on the chair.<br />
The girl paused the game and clicked on the "Leave" button to go back to the main menu.<br />
Julia looked at the hours, it was eight AM, she was a little hungry, she closed the game and turned the computer off.<br />
She got up and walked to the kitchen, opening the fridge, after that, she picked up the milk, the cheese, and a meat hamburger made of artificial meat that Littletato bought.<br />
Then Julia grabbed a frying pan and placed it on one of the stove-tops, she walked to the cabinet and grabbed the sack of bread.<br />
Julia grabbed two slices of bread, grabbed a plate, and placed it on top of the table.<br />
She turned the stove on and waited for a while, then she placed the two slices of bread on the frying pan.<br />
They began to toast on top of the stovetop, she waited for a while, looking below the slices of bread to check if it was burning.<br />
After some minutes, it was ready, Julia turned the stove off and placed the slices on the plate, she grabbed the cheese and artificial meat.<br />
Julia then placed one slice of cheese on the bread, she placed the artificial meat on the frying pan, turning the stove on.<br />
After some minutes, the artificial meat began to get warmer, she removed it from the frying pan and placed it on top of the bread.<br />
The cheese began to melt, she closed the bread and grabbed it, placing it on top of the frying pan and closing it with an aluminum lid.<br />
Julia waited for a while, then she removed the lid and turned the stove off, putting the bread on the plate.<br />
She made a cup of chocolate milk for her, then she walked to the living room and turned the TV on, opening the Vegeflix app and selecting her favorite cartoon, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.<br />
Julia watched some episodes of MLP: FIM while eating and drinking, it was very delicious, she watched more episodes after eating, then she slept on the couch, the cartoon was still playing.<br />
<br />
After some hours, Littletato got home, she opened the front door and closed it, she turned the TV off and woke up Julia with a kiss and a hug.<br />
They prepared dinner together and ate, then they walked to the living room and sat there.<br />
Littletato remembered that she watched Vegetower Rangers when she was little, with the Megazords, laser guns, and robots.<br />
She heard that a new reboot movie of that show launched some days ago, Littletato wanted to watch it.<br />
The girl told that to Julia, she said that she also watched Vegetower Rangers when she was a kid, she said that a friend showed her the show.<br />
Julia suggested for them to watch the new movie.<br />
Littletato was sat at the right of the couch, the side where the front door was.<br />
Julia was sat on the left side of the couch, she left her smartphone on top of the low table that existed on the left of the couch.<br />
After that, Littletato grabbed the TV controller that was on top of the table that existed in the center of the living room.<br />
The girl turned the TV on and opened the Vegeflix app, she started searching for the reboot movie of Vegetower Rangers on Vegeflix's catalog.<br />
Suddenly, Julia's smartphone ringed, she grabbed it to see what it was.<br />
It was Vitória, Julia's sister, she sent a message to Julia through Vegesapp, asking if she could go to Littletato's house next Sunday to make a barbecue.<br />
"Hey honey, it is Vitória, she is asking if she can go here on Sunday to make a barbecue with us," asked Julia, looking at Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that sounds great hon, tell her that she can come," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay," said Julia, who replied to Vitória's message, "Yes, you can come, sis, do you want us to buy the artificial meat and the artificial sausages?"<br />
"Yes, please, I'll help you guys pay for the food, can you also buy garlic bread too? Please ^^, It's gonna be delicious, hehe," replied Vitória.<br />
"Yes, hehe, we're gonna buy everything, don't worry, and thanks, sis," said Julia who then sent a happy emoji.<br />
"Okay sis, thanks. ^^," replied Vitória.<br />
Littletato found the movie on Vegeflix, she pressed play and got up to turn the living room light off.<br />
Julia blocked the screen of her smartphone and placed it on top of the table on the left of the couch.<br />
The couple started watching the movie, it started showing a teenager.<br />
The movie told the story of five teenagers that got superpowers when they got close to a meteor that landed in the city they lived in.<br />
Both of them watched the movie while hugging and caressing each other's hairs, they were happy watching together.<br />
After that, Julia and Littletato turned off the TV and the house lights, they walked to the bedroom and laid on the bed, hugging tight and sleeping happily together.<br />
<br />

		<h4 id="chapter_16_text" class="text_size unselectable" style="text-align: left;">
		It was a Tuesday, Littletato was dreaming about traveling the world by bicycle, she had money and supplies in bags that were tied to her bicycle.<br />
That was a very good way to live life, traveling and stuff, seeing a lot of new places and new faces.<br />
Littletato did that before she stopped at San Francisco, but she uses buses, taxis, and airplanes, now she is on her own.<br />
She was ready to see the world for what it is, Littletato continued riding her bicycle, wanting to arrive in the next city, Concord, CA.<br />
The girl arrived there and stopped by a gas station to fill the tire of her bicycle, she filled it and opened one of her bags, grabbing a bottle of water.<br />
Littletato drank some sips of the bottle of water and stored it in the bag again, she grabbed her smartphone and opened the map app to look for something interesting to see in Concord.<br />
She found some good places, then she stored her smartphone on one of the bags, getting on top of her bicycle.<br />
Littletato started riding to Haute Coffee, a local coffee shop that had a lot of good reviews.<br />
The girl was a little hungry because of the trip, she rode some more and arrived there, parking her bicycle on a road sign and locking it with her bicycle lock.<br />
She got off the bicycle with her wallet, entering the coffee shop, ordered a decaf latte of $4.20 for her, and started walking to a table.<br />
Then she sat at the table, grabbing her smartphone, she waited a while for her coffee while looking at other things to do in Concord.<br />
A waitress arrived with her order, placing it on top of the table, she asked if Littletato wanted something more.<br />
Littletato ordered an Egg Sandwich for $3.95, and also a Mocha for $4.75, the waitress annotated that in her notebook and walked back to behind the counter.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato opened the Vegetify app on her smartphone, she had mobile data, she put to play the soundtrack of the Yuru Camp anime.<br />
She was looking at her right, there were two windows there, outside was a big tree with its leaves swaying in the wind.<br />
The girl put one of her earphones on her right ear, she started listening to the calm songs of the soundtrack while looking at the tree and enjoying the moment.<br />
Littletato continued to listen to the soundtrack while drinking her decaf latte sometimes.<br />
After waiting for some minutes, the waitress arrived with her order, she placed the Mocha and the plate with the Egg Sandwich on top of the table.<br />
"Call me if you want something else okay?" asked the waitress.<br />
"Okay, thanks," replied Littletato with a smile.<br />
She took a picture of the sandwich, decaf latte, and Mocha with her smartphone.<br />
Then Littletato started to eat her egg sandwich while drinking her decaf latte, it was very delicious. it had melted Cabot cheddar on lightly dressed arugula.<br />
Littletato thought that the coffee was very delicious too, she drank and ate it while listening to the Yuru Camp anime soundtrack.<br />
When she finished eating the sandwich and drinking the decaf latte, she started drinking the Mocha while talking to her friends on Vegesapp and Vegebook.<br />
Littletato posted the picture she took of the three items on her Vegesapp status, Carol asked her for the location where she was in.<br />
She sent a message to Carol saying that it was in Concord, CA, Carol replied saying that she wanted to go to Concord because a relative of hers lived there.<br />
Then Littletato sent the location of the Haute Coffee to Carol, Carol replied saying thanks with a face smiling emoji.<br />
After that, Littletato paused the music and stored her earphones in her bag, she stored her smartphone there too.<br />
Littletato walked to the counter to pay for the food, she paid and walked out of the coffee shop.<br />
<br />
The girl wanted to see Louisa May Alcott's Orchard House, it was one of the things that she marked to do in Concord, she heard that it had a lot of history in it.<br />
She grabbed her bicycle and started riding there while looking at the map, she had something to lock her smartphone on her bicycle.<br />
After riding for a while, she arrived there, she parked her bicycle on a street sign on the sidewalk and locked it with her bicycle lock.<br />
The girl looked at the place and read some signs, learning about the house, and the history of the place, there was a Museum Store in there.<br />
Louisa May Alcott wrote the novel called Little Women.<br />
Alcott family's contributed a lot to the fields of literature, education, philosophy, the arts, and social justice through award-winning guided tours, unique educational programs for students of all ages, and lively living history events.<br />
Littletato was amazed to learn about all that, seeing the local culture and history is fun.<br />
Julia was dreaming about traveling the world by van with her family and friends.<br />
She was having fun there, eating stuff and talking, seeing her cousins that she has not seen in a long time.<br />
Julia was smiling, looking at her friends, cousins, and family, her dad was driving, her mother was sitting beside him.<br />
His sister Vitória and her brother Rogerio were sitting on the first row of the van.<br />
<br />
Then both of them woke up, Julia and Littletato looked at each other, they smiled and hugged, kissing each other's lips.<br />
Littletato got up and did her morning necessities, Julia did the same.<br />
They walked to the kitchen and started making breakfast.<br />
After some minutes, they finished and started eating.<br />
"Hey, honey, I started searching for jobs yesterday, I signed up for a total of fifty jobs," said Julia while holding her cup of chocolate milk.<br />
"Oh, that's great honey, are you planning to buy something or just store the money in your bank account?" asked Littletato, curious, fiddling with the bread.<br />
"I'm thinking of buying a computer, and also a desk to put it on.<br />
I want to put the desk on the opposite side of your desk, so we can play games together," said Julia, looking at the room to the right of her, imagining the desk and her computer there.<br />
"I think that's good honey, I was really happy when I bought my computer some months after I bought the house.<br />
Maybe we can play some games together honey, like Rocket League, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare, Overcooked, Osu!" said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, those games seem fun, I watched Alanzoka play Overcooked one day, it was good and fun to play with friends, it's funny I think," replied Julia.<br />
"I agree, honey, I want to play it with you!" said Littletato smiling.<br />
"Me too, honey, I think I'll buy an external hard drive of 1TB to move all the files from my laptop to it, then I'm gonna sell my laptop," said Julia.<br />
"Oh, okay hon, you'll create a VegeSteam account after you buy your computer?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes," replied Julia, "I'm gonna gift you some games then hon," said Littletato.<br />
"Thanks, hon," replied Julia.<br />
After that, the couple finished eating.<br />
Littletato prepared herself to go to work, she was ready and walked to the front door, Julia hugged her and kissed her lips, saying goodbye.<br />
Then Littletato started walking to her job.<br />
After some minutes of walking, she arrived there and entered the building.<br />
<br />
Julia locked the front door and walked to the kitchen, grabbing her bottle of water from the fridge and taking some sips of it, then she stored the bottle on the fridge again.<br />
She walked to the small room to the right of the kitchen, turning on Littletato's computer, when it turned on, she sat at the chair and logged in her account on the computer.<br />
The girl opened Mozilla Vegefox and opened some job websites, she continued signing up for jobs, the girl wanted to find one no matter what it was, as long as it paid well.<br />
Julia applied for fifty jobs, she was happy about that, she closed the web browser tab and opened another, she opened the website called Vegewitch.<br />
She opened the Livestream of the Alanzoka streamer, he was streaming a game called Tarkov, it was a first-person shooter with a lot of realistic features.<br />
The girl liked to watch that streamer, she put the Livestream to play on the speakers and turned on the fullscreen mode of the website.<br />
Julia turned up the volume of the Livestream and got off the chair, she walked to the kitchen and grabbed the bread sack from the cabinet.<br />
She placed two slices of bread on a plate and cut some cheese slices for her, making a sandwich, then she made a cup of chocolate milk for her.<br />
After that, she walked back to the computer room, sitting on the chair and eating and drinking while watching the Livestream.<br />
Julia ate and drank for some minutes while watching, then she finished eating, she grabbed the plate and the cup, placing them on the sink.<br />
She had left her phone on top of the computer desk, it was charging, her laptop was on top of the table in the bedroom.<br />
Her phone vibrated, it was in silent mode, she received a message on Vegesapp.<br />
The girl grabbed the smartphone, it was a message from a business account called "Safeway", it was a supermarket company.<br />
Julia read the message, it said that she was applied for a job interview at 6 PM tomorrow, and asked if she was up for the interview.<br />
She replied saying yes, they replied that it was annotated on their agenda.<br />
<br />
The girl was so happy, she was smiling and believing that she was going to get the job.<br />
Julia could not wait for tomorrow at 6 PM, she continued watching the Livestream of Alanzoka.<br />
She turned her smartphone off so it would charge quickly, then she left the smartphone on top of the table.<br />
The girl remembered that Littletato had a game called Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare on her computer, its shortcut was on the desktop.<br />
Julia closed the Livestream and Mozilla Vegefox too, she opened the game to play and waited for it to load.<br />
It loaded, she selected the Warzone mode, which was the Battle Royale version of CoD: MW, Julia liked to train and practice on that mode.<br />
She perceived that she was getting better every day, she wanted to have her computer so she could play it all the time.<br />
Julia started the match, the Battle Royale game mode consists of one hundred players on a map.<br />
They have to survive and be the last ones alive, only one player can be the winner on solo mode.<br />
On four people, three people, or two people mode, the team of people has to be the last one alive.<br />
The players land on the map and have to find weapons on the buildings of the map, they only arrive there with a pistol.<br />
There are shields for them to protect themselves, they can have three shields, when they get shot, their shields get broken and they have to replace them.<br />
If players are killed, they go to the Gulag where they need to kill another player to win the chance of going back to the game.<br />
Then, if they die in Gulag, they can not play in that match anymore if they are on solo mode.<br />
If they are in team mode, their team can buy them back with money.<br />
Julia was in solo mode, she liked to play alone and feel like she could go anywhere, but she also could not count on anyone.<br />
She landed at the Gorengard Lumber Yard and started picking up weapons and shields from the ground.<br />
The girl found an M4A1 and three shields, she used the three shields to protect herself.<br />
After playing for a while, the match ended, Julia finished in #4, she had made many kills.<br />
Julia continued playing for a while, drinking water sometimes, and eating when she was hungry, stopping to take a break and do some exercise.<br />
It was a little late at night, Littletato had arrived, Julia turned the computer off and greet Littletato.<br />
The couple made dinner and ate, Julia said that she got a job interview and she is going there tomorrow at 6 PM.<br />
Littletato was happy because of that, she smiled while looking at Julia.<br />
Both of them finished eating, they waited for some minutes before laying on the bed.<br />
Then, they laid on the bed and slept, hugging tight in the cold night, Julia slept while thinking of her gaming session with CoD: MW.<br />
<br />
(It was very good revising this chapter.<br />
I wrote it on 29/01/2019.<br />
And I finished revising it on 29/01/2021.<br />
What a coincidence O_O, Wow.<br />
<br />
I loved to revise this chapter while listening to the Yuru Camp soundtrack a lot, I love that anime and that soundtrack.<br />
It was very good, I loved to think about Julia and the job interview.<br />
The conversation between Littletato and Julia about computers and games was so much fun!<br />
I loved searching for good places to spend time in Concord, CA, Haute Coffee and Louisa May Alcott's Orchard House are real places in Concord.<br />
Littletato buying coffee and eating a sandwich on Haute Coffee remembered me of the second episode of the second season of Yuru Camp at 05:00 where Rin buys some tea and a green cake at a coffee shop on the upper floor of where she bought some teas.<br />
I think Littletato and Rin are a little bit alike, and the Littletato website too, I think brown passes that sensation of a calm and homey feel.<br />
Of a place where you can spend time and relax, a warm house of wood in the winter, that's how I feel about this website, Yuru Camp, and The Life of Littletato.<br />
I feel like this is a quiet, calm, and warm place to spend some time and relax, relaxing while reading a story about a potato. xD<br />

		It was a Wednesday, Julia woke up first, she was dreaming about the rain, hearing the sounds of the raindrops and the thunders.<br />
She got out of bed, she had to go to her job interview at the Safeway supermarket franchise that existed in San Francisco.<br />
The girl walked to the bathroom and made her morning necessities, she washed her face, brushed her teeth, and brushed her hair.<br />
After that, she walked to the kitchen, she started making breakfast for her and Littletato.<br />
Julia made two sandwiches, one for her and one for Littletato, both with artificial meat hamburgers and a slice of cheese.<br />
Then she prepared two cups of chocolate milk, she walked to the bedroom and laid beside Littletato.<br />
She hugged Littletato and kissed her lips, it was five and fifty AM, she told Littletato to woke up.<br />
Littletato got off the bed and did her morning necessities, she then walked to the kitchen, she was surprised by the food, it looked delicious.<br />
"Thanks, hon," said Littletato, smiling while hugging Julia.<br />
"No problem, hehe, I love to make you happy and make good for you honey," replied Julia.<br />
Then they sat at the table and started to eat together.<br />
"Hey honey, I'm gonna go to a job interview today at six PM okay?" asked Julia.<br />
"Okay hon, what is the company?" asked Littletato.<br />
"It's a Safeway franchise that exists in San Francisco," replied Julia.<br />
"Oh, that's a good place to work," said Littletato.<br />
Then they finished eating, Littletato grabbed the cups and the plates, placing them on top of the sink.<br />
She started preparing herself to go to work, changing herself, and putting on her shoes, it was almost six AM.<br />
Julia washed the plates and cups, leaving them on the dish dryer.<br />
Then Littletato walked to the front door of the house, she gave a big hug to Julia and walked out, closing the door.<br />
Julia walked to the couch and sat there, she turned on the TV and started watching it.<br />
Some minutes passed, she was tired of the TV, it was seven and forty AM.<br />
The girl turned off the TV, got off the couch, and walked to the computer room, turning Littletato's computer on.<br />
She started signing up for jobs on job websites, she thought that it was not certain that she was going to get the job at the Safeway company.<br />
<br />
Some hours passed, Littletato worked a lot, she fixed and app and did the front-end part of another app, the design of it.<br />
Julia spent her hours on the computer, signing up for jobs, watching Livestreams, eating, and playing games.<br />
It was five and forty PM, Littletato arrived home, she locked the door, Julia was on Littletato's computer.<br />
"I'm home honey, Tadaima, hehe," said Littletato, leaving her bag on the couch.<br />
"Okaeri honey," said Julia, smiling, she looked at Littletato.<br />
Julia then turned off the computer, walked to the living room, and hugged Littletato tight, kissing her lips.<br />
Then they made the afternoon coffee, they ate together, it was delicious.<br />
After that, Julia started preparing herself to go to the job interview, she grabbed her smartphone and asked for the location of the company on the Vegesapp app.<br />
The Safeway company sent her the location, then she blocked the screen of her smartphone.<br />
She placed the clothes she was going to use on top of the bed, then she took a bath and prepared herself.<br />
Julia walked to the front door, she had her bag with her smartphone, the spare key of the house, and some money for a bus.<br />
"Good luck honey, I hope you get the job," said Littletato, hugging her and smiling, kissing her cheek.<br />
"Thanks, hon," replied Julia, smiling, then she got out of the house and started walking to the bus stop.<br />
She got a bus that passed close to the location where she was going to make the job interview, it was a bus from the Muni company, she paid $2.50 for it.<br />
Julia entered the bus and paid for it, she sat there, the bus started driving.<br />
After some minutes, she arrived at the location, she asked the bus to stop, it stopped and she got out.<br />
Then she saw the place where the company was and started walking towards it, then she entered inside it.<br />
Julia talked to the woman who was part of the customer attendance service staff, she said that she was coming there for an interview.<br />
The woman accompanied her to a room and she sat there, there was a supermarket clerk there.<br />
He started asking questions and she started replying to them, questions about past experiences, about Profit and Loss, and other supermarket things.<br />
After some minutes, the interview ended, Julia thought that she did well, the interviewer thanked her, after that, she left the building.<br />
Then she started walking to the bus stop, she caught a bus to go back home, the bus arrived, she entered it and paid $2.50 for it.<br />
After waiting for some minutes, Julia arrived home, she unlocked the front door with the spare key and entered the house.<br />
"Hey honey, welcome back!" said Littletato, smiling, she was sat at the house.<br />
"Thanks, hon," said Julia, "Did you get it?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I don't know, they're gonna analyze and give me the response tomorrow, but the clerk was very happy," replied Julia, sitting beside Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that's good honey, I hope you get it," said Littletato, hugging Julia.<br />
<br />
It was seven and thirty PM, Julia was a little hungry, "Let's eat something hon?" asked Julia.<br />
"Yeah, let's eat, and wait for a while, so we can go to sleep early," replied Littletato.<br />
"Okay hon," said Julia, who started walking to the kitchen.<br />
The couple made two sandwiches, there was a bottle of Coca-cola on the fridge, Littletato grabbed and filled two cups with it.<br />
Then they ate, it was delicious, Littletato loved the things in the sandwich.<br />
After that, the couple walked to the computer room, Littletato sat at the chair of her computer, turning it on.<br />
Julia walked to the bedroom and wore some more comfortable clothes, then she grabbed her laptop and walked back to the computer room.<br />
The girl placed her laptop on top of the desk, on the right side of Littletato's computer.<br />
She turned the laptop on and opened Mozilla Vegefox, she opened VegeTube.<br />
"Hey, honey, wanna read a story with me on Veggepad?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, honey, what is Veggepad?" asked Julia.<br />
"It is a story website, you can read and write stories in it," replied Littletato.<br />
"Okay hon," said Julia, then Littletato opened Mozilla Vegefox and opened the Veggepad website.<br />
She began to scroll on the feed, looking for a specific author, stane2, she found it and clicked on his profile.<br />
"What are we gonna read hon?" asked Julia, looking at the screen.<br />
"It's a story by the author called stane2, he writes a lot of good stories, I think he updated the story called 'The Life of Bigbeet'," replied Littletato.<br />
"That story sounds like fun, the story of a beetroot," said Julia while giggling a little.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Littletato while smiled, who clicked on the story.<br />
<br />
They started to read, the chapter had two thousand words, it was a little long.<br />
It talked about the life of a beetroot who wanted to be a traveler, she wished to become an astronaut someday.<br />
The name of the beetroot was Sasha, she was a redhead, the girl had eighteen years old, she lived in the city of Maringá, in the state of Paraná that exists in the country of Brazil.<br />
She worked in a book store, she was happy about her job because she could borrow books from it to read, she loved to read.<br />
Sasha also liked to talk to her Brazilian friends, she was very good at school and had some friends there.<br />
The girl liked to play games on her Vbox One, she played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Overcooked, and No Man's Sky.<br />
Her mother worked a lot to support the family, she was successful in her work, she worked in a technology company.<br />
Sasha's father was a trucker, he took long trips to deliver products, gas, and water, she could not see him too often.<br />
The girl had a friend called Yuri, he also studied in the school that Sasha attended, he also had a Vbox One, she played games with him.<br />
Sasha always dreamt of traveling far away, visiting a lot of places, eating different food, eating all kinds of food but insects, snakes, cats, and dogs, Sasha did not want to eat those.<br />
One day, she was sat on her computer's chair, it was six and thirty PM, she was a little tired from a match of COD: MW, she reclined in the chair and stretched herself.<br />
She closed the game and got up, walking to the kitchen, her mother was home already.<br />
"Mom, do we still have some Coca-cola cans?" asked Sasha to her mother who was in her room.<br />
"Yes, I think we have three, check the refrigerator," replied Sasha's mother from her room, she was called Claudia and had blond hair.<br />
Then Sasha opened the refrigerator and grabbed a can of Coca-cola, then she walked to the kitchen cabinet, she opened it and grabbed a packet of Doritos.<br />
She started walking to her bedroom.<br />
"Hey, mom, I'm gonna watch a movie okay?" asked her from the upper hall of the house, the hall that led to the room of Sasha's parents and the bathroom.<br />
"Okay sweetie," replied Claudia, who was laid on her bed, resting.<br />
"At twenty at night, I'm gonna start making dinner, will you help me sweetie?" asked Claudia.<br />
"Yes mom, I will," replied Sasha, "Thanks," said Claudia.<br />
"No problem, hehe," said Sasha, who continued walking to her bedroom, she left the Doritos packet on top of the table along with the can of Coca-cola.<br />
<br />
Littletato saved the link of the chapter on her website, she was a little tired, she stretched herself, Julia did that too.<br />
They were a little tired of reading, Julia kissed Littletato's cheek, "Hey honey, I'm going to sleep are you coming with me?" asked Julia.<br />
"Yes, hehe, I'm just gonna read a chapter of The Story of the Bulkan Siblings okay honey?" asked Littletato, who gave a quick kiss on Julia's lips.<br />
"Alright honey," said Julia, who kissed Littletato's lips back, then she turned her laptop off and left it charging.<br />
She walked to the bedroom and laid on the bed, covering herself with the blanket and closing her eyes, trying to sleep.<br />
Littletato opened another story of the author called stane2, it was called The Story of the Bulkan Siblings, she started to read one chapter of it.<br />
It was very interesting, Littletato liked to see the adventures of the brothers Izaque and Lulu, she finished reading the chapter and turned off her computer.<br />
Then the girl walked to the bedroom and laid on the bed alongside Julia, she covered herself with the blanket and hugged Julia tight, cuddling with her.<br />
<br />
(I loved revising this chapter, I started revising it on 02/02/2021.<br />
And finished revising it on 04/02/2021.<br />
<br />
It was very good to revise, I wrote that Sasha is beetroot and is a redhead because I thought of Sasha from the Shingeki No Kyojin anime, the potato girl.<br />
I loved to write about Julia's interview, and about Sasha's story, which is "The Life of Bigbeet", the big beet, the opposite of Littletato, which is little, and a potato...<br />
Tell me the name of a fruit or vegetable that is the opposite of potatoes, please.<br />
I want to continue writing more Littletato and also write the "spin-off" version of Littletato, which is The Life of Bigbeet.<br />
I think a spin-off is something that is not shown in the original story and is shown in a side story.<br />
Anyway, thank you for reading chapter 17 of The Life of Littletato, send me a message on my social media saying what you thought about the chapter, please.<br />
Thanks, bye. :3)

		It was a Thursday, Littletato was awake, she got up and prepared herself for her job.<br />
She made breakfast and woke up Julia, then she ate with her.<br />
Littletato walked to the front door and hugged Julia, kissing her lips, she got out of the house and started walking to her job, it was six AM.<br />
Julia stretched and walked to the living room, she laid on the couch, "Hm... I slept really well last night," thought Julia.<br />
Then she got up and walked to the computer room, she turned Littletato's computer on.<br />
After that, Julia walked to the bedroom, grabbing her smartphone that was in the wall socket, it was fully charged, she removed the charger from the socket.<br />
Julia then walked to the computer room, she sat at the chair of Littletato's computer and began fiddling with her smartphone while waiting for the computer to boot up.<br />
The computer turned on, she looked at the Windows home screen, the girl opened a game called Osu! to play, it was a music and rhythm game.<br />
She looked at her smartphone screen, opened the Vegesapp app, and looked at her messages.<br />
There was a message from the Safeway company, saying that she was applied for the job.<br />
Julia was so happy, she smiled while looking at it, then she clicked on it and replied saying thank you.<br />
Littletato could use her smartphone at work, as long as it was not used for too much time.<br />
Julia sent a message to Littletato saying that she got the job, Littletato was so happy about that, she sent a smiling face emoji to Julia along with "Congratulations Honey!"<br />
Then Julia smiled from ear to ear, "I begin working tomorrow, from twelve PM to six PM," said her in a message to Littletato.<br />
"That's good honey! That means you'll be out half of the day right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, hehe, I think it will be great," replied Julia.<br />
"I'm happy for you hon, I have to work right now, see you later sweetie!" said Littletato.<br />
"Okay, see you later hon ^^," replied Julia.<br />
Then Julia looked at the computer screen, the "Osu!" game was open, playing the music theme of the game.<br />
She locked the screen of her smartphone, then she left it on top of the table and started playing Osu! for some hours.<br />
The girl had to click on circles and hold the mouse button on sliders to the beat of the song, she liked to play that game.<br />
<br />
After some time playing, Julia was a little tired, she stretched and yawned, then she turned off the computer.<br />
It was eight AM, she got up and walked to the kitchen, grabbing her bottle of water and drinking a little of it.<br />
She wanted to get out to go for a walk, her legs were a little tired from sitting down for too much time.<br />
The girl grabbed a dark-grey empty backpack and placed her bottle of water inside the backpack.<br />
Julia could go on her bicycle but she wanted to go on foot, she walked to the bedroom and wore her socks and blue sneakers.<br />
She walked to the front door and opened it, then she walked out of the house, locking the front door and storing the key in her pocket.<br />
The girl started walking to a park that she knew where was, some people looked at her, saying good morning, she said good morning back.<br />
Julia looked at the trees, the leaves, and nature, it was very beautiful, it was a little chill, the sun was not too hot.<br />
It was very good weather to go for a walk, she continued walking for some minutes.<br />
Yam was walking too, he was walking in the opposite direction that Julia was walking.<br />
They both stopped and looked at each other, "Hey Julia," said Yam.<br />
"Hey, Yam, nice to see you," said Julia while smiling.<br />
"I was going for a walk, my job starts at twelve PM, it is very good to walk while is chill right?" asked Yam, hugging himself.<br />
"Yeah, I agree, hehe," said Julia.<br />
"So, how's Littletato?" asked Yam.<br />
"She's good, working very hard, my sister said that she's gonna come to our house Sunday to make a barbecue with us," said Julia, smiling.<br />
Yam smiled back at Julia, "Oh, that's good, can I come too?" asked Yam, thinking about artificial sausages and artificial meat.<br />
"Yes, of course! Hehe," replied Julia, "Okay, hehe," said Yam.<br />
"Is your sister in town?" asked Julia.<br />
"No, she is on the house of my parents, in New York, she only comes on Mondays or the weekend, she haves school," said Yam.<br />
"Oh! My sister lives there too, I would like your sister, she must be a cutie, how many years old is she?" asked Julia while smiling.<br />
"She is twelve years old, I'll tell you when she's in town okay?" asked Yam.<br />
"Okay, thanks, well, I gotta go, it was nice to talk with you again," replied Julia while smiling.<br />
"It was nice to see you too, Julia," said Yam smiling.<br />
Then they both followed their ways, Julia arrived at the park and sat there for some minutes, feeling the soft wind and hearing the trees, drinking her water sometimes.<br />
Julia then started walking back home, she was happy about her walk and feeling great, she was happy that she talked with Yam.<br />
The girl arrived at home, she unlocked the front door and walked to the bedroom, removing the bottle of water from the backpack.<br />
Then she stored the backpack inside the wardrobe and walked to the kitchen, filling the bottle with water and storing it on the fridge.<br />
After that, she was a little tired, she locked the front door and walked to the bedroom, lying on the bed and sleeping.<br />
<br />
She slept for some hours, when she woke up it was six PM, Littletato has arrived.<br />
Julia got up, walked to the bathroom, and washed her face, then she walked to the kitchen, Littletato changed herself.<br />
The couple was a little hungry, "Hey honey, what about we order a pizza?" asked Littletato to Julia.<br />
"I think that sounds good honey," said Julia.<br />
Then Littletato started looking at the catalog of the VegeIfood mobile app looking for a pizzeria, she found one and ordered a big Marguerita for her and Julia.<br />
Julia and Littletato sat on the couch, waiting for the pizza to arrive, Littletato had ordered a bottle of 2 Liters of Coca-cola too.<br />
The pizzeria where she ordered the pizza was Sabrosa Pizza, it had good reviews on the Internet.<br />
After some minutes of waiting, the pizza arrived, Littletato paid for it and grabbed the pizza and the bottle of Coca-cola.<br />
They both walked to the kitchen to eat, Littletato left the pizza on top of the table, she grabbed two plates and placed them on top of the table.<br />
Julia grabbed two cups and opened the bottle of Coca-cola, filling the two cups with it.<br />
Littletato cut the pizza into twelve pieces, she placed two slices on each plate, then she closed the box of the pizza and sat at the table.<br />
Julia also sat, she started eating the pizza along with Littletato, it was very delicious, the Coca-cola was deliciously cold too.<br />
"Hey honey, how was your day?" asked Littletato.<br />
"It was very good hon, I got all happy this morning because they accepted me on the job, I told you right?" asked Julia.<br />
"Yes, I remember honey," said Littletato.<br />
"And after that, I played some Osu! and got out for a walk, I started walking to the park close to the mall.<br />
In the middle of the way, I met with Yam, and we talked a little.<br />
I told him about the barbecue that we're gonna make with Vitória, he wanted to come, I said yes, is that okay with you hon?" asked Julia.<br />
"Yeah, it's okay honey, but you got to tell Vitória," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey, I'm gonna tell her after we finish eating, this pizza is so good honey," said Julia while looking at the pizza.<br />
"I agree, it is very delicious, and even more delicious along with some Coca-cola," said Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Julia.<br />
Then they continued eating, Julia and Littletato finished eating, Julia washed the dishes and Littletato helped her.<br />
<br />
After that, Littletato walked to the computer room, she turned on her computer and opened the Vegecloud website.<br />
(Vegecloud is a website where you can hear songs from artists and hear what the artists likes and reposts, you can upload your owns songs to it too.)<br />
She put to play a Dubstep song a little low, Julia was sat on the couch of the living room, fiddling with her phone.<br />
Julia said to Vitória that a friend of theirs was coming to the barbecue too, she said that through Vegesapp.<br />
Vitória said okay, and asked for the phone number of that friend, then Julia sent a message to Littletato asking for Yam's phone number.<br />
Littletato sent the phone number to Julia and she sent it to Vitória, Vitória and Yam started talking and knowing each other.<br />
Julia then got up, she walked to the computer room and hugged Littletato's neck, kissing her cheek.<br />
"Hey, honey, I'm out of disposable shavers, do you think the convenience store is still open?" asked Julia, it was eleven PM.<br />
"Yes, hon, I think it's open right now," said Littletato, who was in the computer, using the Vegecord computer app to check the news of the Vegecord servers of some games.<br />
Littletato also used Vegecord to talk to her friends online.<br />
"Oh, okay, I'm gonna go there honey, I'll lock the door okay?" asked Julia.<br />
"Okay," said Littletato, who kissed Julia's lips and smiled, Julia then grabbed her purse and stored her smartphone in her pocket.<br />
She walked to the front door, got out of the house, and locked the front door, she started walking to the convenience store.<br />
When she got there, she entered the store and started looking for the personal hygiene section of the store.<br />
Julia found some good disposable shavers and grabbed them, walking to the cashier, she paid for them and started walking home.<br />
She got home, opened the front door, and entered inside, locking the door and storing the shavers on the wardrobe.<br />
The girl walked to the computer room and kissed Littletato's lips, hugging her.<br />
After that, Julia grabbed her smartphone from her pocket and walked to the living room, sitting on the couch and turning the TV on.<br />
Littletato was using the Veggepad website to write a story of her, that story was called Kezzakam.<br />
Carol and Yam liked to read Kezzakam, they thought that it was a very good and interesting story.<br />
They loved to receive a notification on Vegebook saying that a new chapter of Kezzakam was published.<br />
Littletato also liked to post her digital drawings on the Vegiantart website, the things she drew on the Paint Tool SAI software program.<br />
The girl also liked to use the Vegewitter website, it is a website where you can follow famous people to see what they post and follow companies to see new products or things.<br />
She liked to post Vegeweets sometimes too, saying what she is feeling, and what she thinks about the world.<br />
Littletato also liked to read the Vegeweets from game companies, to see the news about new games being launched.<br />
Julia also had a Vegewitter, she liked to read Littletato's Vegeweets.<br />
The couple was a little tired, Littletato wrote some words of her story called Kezzakam, Julia was accepted on the job.<br />
Littletato turned off her computer, Julia turned off the TV and walked to the bedroom, Littletato did that too.<br />
Julia left her phone charging on the wall socket, they both laid on the bed and hugged tight, sleeping in the cold night.<br />

		It was a Friday, Julia had to work today, but only at ten AM, Julia woke up first, did her morning needs and walked to the kitchen.<br />
The girl prepared breakfast, she was happy because she was going to work on a new job today, she thought that it was going to be hard to learn, but she was eager to learn.<br />
Julia woke up Littletato, she did her morning needs, and walked to the kitchen, they ate breakfast together.<br />
Littletato prepared herself to go to work, "Oh, honey, you have work today right?" asked Littletato while putting on her shoes<br />
"Yes, but only at ten AM," said Julia.<br />
"Okay honey, I'm gonna bring a packed lunch for me to eat at work today at lunchtime," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay, hon," replied Julia.<br />
Then Littletato walked to the front door, Julia hugged and kissed her, Littletato kissed back and opened the door, she locked the door and started walking to work.<br />
Julia stretched herself, she walked to the kitchen and drank some water, then she stored her bottle of water in the fridge again.<br />
After that, Julia walked to the computer room and turned on Littletato's computer, she logged in on her computer account.<br />
Then the girl opened the Vegefox web browser, she put to play a Dubstep playlist of hers on the Vegecloud website, she was dancing a little and smiling.<br />
She started searching on the Internet on how to work in a supermarket, and what you have to do there.<br />
Julia learned a lot about the job, she looked at the computer clock, it was seven AM.<br />
The girl continued to learn about the supermarket job, she wrote the things she learned on a text file on the computer to remember them easily.<br />
After that, Julia was a little hungry, she wanted to watch something too, like an anime.<br />
Littletato had coded a Python script called Watch_History.py, which made it possible for the user to register what it watched on text files.<br />
By just selecting the media type (anime, cartoon, series, movie, video), and typing the media name.<br />
Julia made a sandwich made of artificial meat hamburger, melted cheese, and mayonnaise, there was a can of Coca-cola on the refrigerator door.<br />
She opened the can of Coca-cola and grabbed the plate with the sandwich, walking to the computer room.<br />
Julia opened an anime website where she watched anime, she started using it in 2013.<br />
The girl put to play an episode of the anime called "Yuru Camp", she and Littletato watched it some months ago.<br />
She started watching it while eating the sandwich and drinking the can of Coca-cola.<br />
It was very relaxing and fun, she loved to watch that anime, after some minutes, the episode ended, it was seven and thirty AM.<br />
<br />
Julia stretched a little, she opened the Watch_History.py Python script, typed two, and pressed enter, she selected two again and selected the media type.<br />
Then she typed the media name, which was the name of the episode of the anime, then it was registered on Julia's watched media text files.<br />
After that, Julia brought the plate and can of Coca-cola to the kitchen, she placed the plate on the sink and the can on the recyclable plastic bag.<br />
She wanted to play something, Julia closed the web browser, she opened the game called Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare.<br />
Julia opened the Warzone mode of the game, which was the Battle Royale version of COD: MW.<br />
The girl played some matches of the game for some hours while drinking water and eating when she was hungry.<br />
After playing for a while, it was nine AM, she turned off the computer and prepared her things to go to work, prepared her purse, her smartphone was charging.<br />
She changed herself and grabbed her smartphone, it was nine and a half AM, she told Littletato that she was going to work.<br />
Littletato said okay, Julia walked to the front door, stored her smartphone in her purse, and grabbed the spare key of the house.<br />
Julia opened the door and got out, closing it, then she began walking to her work while looking sometimes on the GPS of her smartphone to know where it was.<br />
After walking for some minutes, Julia arrived at the supermarket called Safeway, she entered the establishment.<br />
She talked to the manager saying that it was her first time working there, and also in a supermarket job.<br />
Julia was going to work as a supermarket replenisher, she is responsible for stocking and maintaining shelves and displays in the supermarket.<br />
The girl has to ensure that all shelves and displays are well stocked and are visually appealing.<br />
She has to place the products that are closest to expiry at the front of the displays.<br />
Julia also disposed of the cardboard boxes and packaging as the products were transferred from the pallets to the shelves and display units following the supermarket's procedures.<br />
The girl worked there for some hours, she had a lunchtime, she ate in a restaurant close to there, then she worked a little more, it was six PM.<br />
She finished her work and walked home, her salary was $10.89 per hour or $1,815 per month, it was very good, she was paid bi-weekly and was going to receive $824 bi-weekly.<br />
Julia was a little tired, she arrived home and opened the front door, Littletato had arrived already.<br />
"Oh, hey honey, you're back from work," said Littletato, who was sat at the kitchen table, she had prepared the dinner already.<br />
"I'm just gonna take a bath and we eat okay honey?" asked Julia.<br />
"Okay hon," replied Littletato, then Julia left her purse on the couch, she walked to the kitchen.<br />
"Put my phone on to charge love?" asked Julia, who kissed the cheek of Littletato, "Okay sweetie," replied Littletato.<br />
Then Julia walked to the bedroom, she prepared herself to take a bath, took a bath and wore some clothes, then she ate dinner alongside Littletato.<br />
<br />
After that, Julia stretched a little, she hugged Littletato and kissed her lips, smiling.<br />
"I'm gonna play a game okay hon?" asked Littletato, Julia replied ok, then Littletato walked to the computer room and turned her computer on.<br />
She was going to play COD: MW, the Warzone mode of it, Julia started to wash the dishes, after some minutes, she finished washing them.<br />
Julia then grabbed her phone which was charging in the wall socket of the bedroom, removing the charger from the socket.<br />
The girl walked to the computer room, she sat at the side of Littletato, looking at her playing.<br />
After that, Julia turned the screen of her phone on, she looked at her notifications, Julia replied to some messages on Vegesapp.<br />
She told Vitória that today was her first day at work, Vitória was very happy about that, she sent a smile emoji to Julia.<br />
The manager of the supermarket said that they pay every two weeks, every Friday.<br />
Julia was happy about her first job, she was excited to work again on Monday.<br />
The girl opened her laptop which was on top of the table, she turned it on and opened the Mozilla Vegefox web browser.<br />
She opened the Vegecloud website to listen to some songs, Julia had a playlist of Dubstep songs she liked, she put it to play, using her earphones.<br />
Julia had the Paint Tool SAI program installed on her laptop, the one Littletato used to teach her how to draw digitally.<br />
She had some .sai files saved on her computer, she needed to make the line art of them to draw.<br />
The girl opened a drawing of a flower that she was making, she continued making the line art of it.<br />
Littletato was on her third match of the game, she was very good at it, and had made many kills.<br />
There was a calm song playing on Vegecloud, Julia was listening to it while drawing, she was using the mouse because the touchpad was bad for drawing.<br />
Julia and Littletato kept doing their things, playing, and drawing while listening to songs.<br />
It was ten PM, Littletato was now playing some Vegerraria, it was a survival game, like Vegecraft, but two-dimensional, she had a house in it and some NPCs lived in that house.<br />
Julia had made a lot of progress on her drawing, she finished the line art and painted a little, she was now playing Osu!, a rhythm game.<br />
She had to click on circles to the beat of the song that was playing, the range of difficulty was measured by stars, they ranged from one to ten.<br />
Julia could play up to four stars, she thought that she was very good at the game, and was very confident in her skills.<br />
The girl played some songs and stretched a little, Littletato and her were a little tired, they turned off their computers and walked to the bedroom, sleeping and hugging tight.<br />
<br />
Littletato was dreaming about a green field of grass, the grass was moving with the wind, it was very fresh there.<br />
Julia was there with her, they were wearing beautiful dresses, Julia was wearing a light-blue one, Littletato was wearing a dark-gray dress, they were kids in that dream.<br />
They both started to walk towards a castle, looked like that castle was abandoned for some hundreds of years.<br />
The couple started walking inside the castle, it was very dark, they had to walk by holding on walls.<br />
After some minutes of walking, they started feeling a little nauseated, they fell on the ground and blacked out.<br />
Then, they found themselves sat at a table, there was a woman there, she had white hair color, a black iris, and white pupils.<br />
She said that her name was Echidna and that she was the Witch of Greed.<br />
There was tea on the table, there was an open umbrella above the table too.<br />
Littletato and Julia thought that they should not trust a witch and her tea, they did not drink the tea.<br />
Echidna said that they needed to do a trial to remove the magical barrier of someplace, so some hybrid creatures could leave that place.<br />
They said that they did not know where that place was and that they were not there to do that, Echidna looked a little disappointed.<br />
After that, the couple got up, they started walking in the opposite direction where the witch was, there was the hallway of that dark castle.<br />
They walked more and more in the dark, holding each other's hands and putting their hands on the walls.<br />
Julia and Littletato got out of the castle, they stood on the stairs of the castle, there was a tall and huge Titan rushing to the castle.<br />
The tip of the castle was of the same height as the neck of the Titan, it had brown armors on all parts of his body except for the moving parts.<br />
It had gray hair and yellow eyes, it roared and continued rushing towards the castle, then another Titan with medium black hair and green eyes appeared by his left, punching his face.<br />
The two began to fight, Julia and Littletato knew the names of them, they were Reiner and Eren, Eren was winning.<br />
Julia and Littletato continued walking, there was a man with a white coat, looking like a scientist, a redhead woman was accompanying him.<br />
Then the couple looked to their right, there was a black-haired boy with a black and a light-blue sword, and a redhead girl with a white sword.<br />
They were Kirito and Asuna, and they fought in the Aincrad virtual world, using a VR device called NerveGear.<br />
After that, Littletato and Julia continued walking on that green field, they were hearing a song called "Torch of Liberty" by an artist called KANA-BOON.<br />
That was a very weird dream, they saw a pink-haired boy being angry and breathing fire from his mouth, with a talking blue cat by his side, a blond girl with keys, and a dark-blue-haired boy who could make ice with his hands.<br />
They saw a pink-haired girl with some weird loose clothes like they were alien clothes, it had a creature flying close to her, it had bat wings.<br />
An orange-haired boy was close to her, a brown-haired girl which was his sister, and a blue-haired girl, the blue-haired girl said "Rito?"<br />
Walking a little more, Littletato and Julia saw a dark-blue-haired girl camping, she had mounted her tent and was reading a book close to her campfire.<br />
She had made yakisoba and kiritanpo for her, she had a portable campfire, the couple was happy to see her camping, her name was Rin, Rin liked to camp alone.<br />
There was a pink-haired girl who was very energetic, she was camping too, alone, a little far away from Rin.<br />
Then the dream changed to another dream, the couple continued to sleep together and dream other dreams.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 26/02/2019.<br />
And finished revising it on 19/02/2021.<br />
I finished revising chapter number 19 on day 19 :).<br />
<br />
It was very good revising this chapter, I was very happy about it, searching for how salary is paid in the United States, and writing about the anime references in the last part.<br />
I revised this chapter while listening to the "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZIqgCHrhRM" target="_blank">Yuru Camp soundtrack</a>".<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZIqgCHrhRM" target="_blank" class="text_light_salmon text_hover_light_salmon">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZIqgCHrhRM</a><br />
I also listened to a mix of anime openings, they are very good, I like the Bunny Girl Senpai one.<br />
Thank you for reading ^^.)

		It was a Saturday, Littletato was sat on the couch, she yawned a little, looking at her phone, it was eight AM, she had nothing to do today.<br />
Julia was sat by her side, they were both fiddling with their phones.<br />
Littletato said that she was thinking about buying a car on the Internet, to travel far places, Julia said that it was a good idea.<br />
Then Littletato started searching for a car online, she had $1.560.000 stored in her bank account, she wanted to buy a "Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Roadster" that cost $420.000.<br />
She bought the car by making a bank transfer to the company that had the car in its car warehouse.<br />

The girl told Julia that she had bought the car, Julia was happy.<br />
"Which color is it honey?" asked Julia.<br />
"It is golden, honey," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, I like golden, hehe, it's a beautiful color for a car, makes it look glamorous and beautiful," said Julia.<br />
"I agree honey," said Littletato, smiling, "I'm gonna pick up the car at six PM," continued Littletato, "Okay honey," said Julia.<br />

Littletato asked for a taxi, after some minutes of waiting, the taxi appeared.<br />
They both entered the taxi and told the location where they wanted to go to the taxi driver.<br />
Julia and Littletato were going to that coffee shop where they met for the first place.<br />
They waited for a while, looking at the scenery, the morning in San Francisco.<br />

Littletato and Julia waited for a little, they were both fiddling with their phones.<br />
Julia had told Vitória that Littletato bought a car, Littletato told Carol that she bought the car.<br />
The sisters of the couple said that they were happy for Littletato, and asked for a picture of the car.<br />
Littletato said that she was going to send one when she gets the car at six PM.<br />
After some minutes, the orders of the couple arrived, they thanked the waitress and stored their phones in their pockets.<br />
The couple started to eat and drink, the coffees and savories were delicious.<br />
Julia liked the taste of the coffee in there, it was the same taste from when she met Littletato.<br />
<br />
After some minutes, they finished eating, it was very delicious.<br />
Before eating, they took some pictures of the food and coffees, they posted in their Vegegram stories, mentioning the account of the coffee shop.<br />
Then they threw the things on the trash can and walked to the counter to pay for the meal, they paid and got out of the coffee shop.<br />
Littletato called another taxi, after some minutes, the taxi arrived, they both entered inside the taxi, Littletato told it to go to a place close to her house.<br />
Then, the taxi driver started driving there, Littletato was looking into her phone, seeing a photo of her car, it was nine AM.<br />

Littletato sat on the couch, fiddling with her phone, she added the business account of the car dealership in her Vegesapp.<br />
They sent her the location of the car dealership, she was going there by taxi.<br />
Julia grabbed her things to take a bath, she walked to the bathroom, which had its door close to the door of the laundry room, and started to take a bath.<br />
Littletato locked the screen of her phone, she walked to the computer room and put her phone to charge there.<br />
She stretched a little and walked to the kitchen, opened the fridge, and drank some sips of her water bottle.<br />
Littletato heard the shower of the bathroom, even if the bathroom door was closed.<br />
The girl walked to the computer room, sitting on her office chair with wheels, it was very comfortable.<br />
She turned her computer on and waited for it to boot up, after some seconds, it boots up.<br />
Littletato logged into her computer account, opened the Battle.net game launcher, and opened the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game.<br />
After that, she started playing some matches of the game, she played two matches of the game.<br />
<br />
Julia was out of the bathroom, she had already dried herself and wore some clothes.<br />
She walked to the computer room, kissing Littletato's lips and hugging her, Littletato hugged her back.<br />
Then Littletato finished her current match, "I'm gonna take a bath okay honey? You can use the computer if you want," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey, thanks," replied Julia, then Littletato walked to the bedroom, getting her stuff to take a bath, she walked to the bathroom and started bathing.<br />
The cold water was relaxing, she was a little tired, she was getting rested in the bathroom.<br />
Julia logged out of Littletato's account and logged into her account, she opened the Osu! game to play a little and started playing some songs of it.<br />
Littletato continued taking her bath, the mirror that was also a bathroom cabinet above the sink was blurry.<br />
After some minutes, Littletato finished her bath, dried herself, and wore some clothes.<br />
She got out of the bathroom and walked to the computer room, hugging Julia from behind.<br />
"What'cha playing honey?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Just some Osu," said Julia.<br />
"Oh, that is a very good game," replied Littletato, kissing Julia's cheek.<br />

"Hey honey, Yam said that he is gonna bring some artificial chicken," said Littletato.<br />
"Oh, really? I love artificial chicken, it's been some time since I ate some," replied Julia, smiling while looking at her.<br />
Then Littletato smiled back, it was eleven and thirty AM, she got up and walked to the kitchen, looking at Julia.<br />
"Hey honey, I'm a little hungry, wanna start making lunch with me?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey," said Julia, then she finished her play of a song, closing the game and turning the computer off.<br />

There were rice and beans, artificial meat, eggs, and artificial salad, not made from vegetables.<br />
Julia and Littletato ate, it was very delicious, they talked a little while eating, then, they finished eating.<br />
After that, Littletato got up, grabbed the plates, forks, and knives, and then washed the dishes along with Julia.<br />
Littletato walked to the computer room and turned her computer on, she started to play Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Multi-player for a while.<br />
Then some hours passed, Julia played on her laptop and also listened to some music, and Littletato played games on her computer.<br />
<br />
It was six PM, Littletato walked to a safe place on the San Andreas Multi-player game, in the city, she stopped there and closed the game.<br />
"Hey honey, I'm gonna go get the car, and also gonna go to the supermarket," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey, can you bring me an artificial chocolate?" asked Julia, smiling.<br />
"Oh, okay hon, I'm gonna bring it to you," said Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato walked to the bedroom, she changed herself and grabbed her purse with some money in it.<br />

"It is right there," said the woman in the reception, pointing to a place in the car dealership.<br />
Then Littletato started walking there, the car was on the lower floor of the car dealership.<br />
She got the keys to the car and entered it, it was very good and comfortable, it had a good smell of new.<br />
The girl turned it on, the light on its dashboard was very bright and beautiful.<br />
She put the car on the first shift, it has been some time since she drove a car, but she remembered how to do it.<br />
Littletato started taking her left foot off the clutch and started putting her right foot on the accelerator gently.<br />
The guy who gave her the key to the car said "It's all yours," with his arm on top of the space where the door window would be if it was closed.<br />
<br />
After that, Littletato said thanks and got out of the building with her golden Lamborghini Aventador, she started driving around the city.<br />
The car had GPS on it, she stopped by a traffic signal and programmed the GPS to go to the supermarket.<br />
Littletato started driving there, the car also had a radio and MP3 player, it had Bluetooth.<br />
She put some good music on her phone through Vegetify to play and linked the phone to the car's radio through Bluetooth.<br />
The girl put to play a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpNYYkXxT-A" target="_blank">"Take That" by RIOT</a>, it was a very good song.<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpNYYkXxT-A" target="_blank" class="text_light_salmon text_hover_light_salmon">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpNYYkXxT-A</a><br />
Littletato was happy while listening to the music, she arrived at the supermarket, parking her golden car in the parking lot in front of the supermarket.<br />
She turned off the Bluetooth of her phone and put on her earphones, plugging them on the phone, listening to the same song on repeat.<br />
Then Littletato entered the supermarket, she got a plastic basket and walked to the artificial meat part of the supermarket.<br />
Littletato grabbed some artificial meat, sausages, and some garlic bread, she also grabbed some artificial chocolate that Julia asked for.<br />
The girl also grabbed two bottles of Coca-cola of three liters each, then she walked to the cashier, giving the products to the woman.<br />
Littletato waited for the woman to pack the things and paid her, saying thanks with a smile, leaving the supermarket while holding the bags.<br />
She walked to her car, pressing the button on the car key and entering inside it through the driver's door.<br />
The girl left the bags on top of the passenger's seat, turning the car on and turning the Bluetooth of her phone on.<br />
Littletato started driving, she got out of the parking lot and started driving home, she stopped at a traffic light and programmed the GPS to go there.<br />
A lot of people looked at her smiling, a kid said "Look mom, that car is so beautiful!" while pointing to Littletato's car.<br />
She accelerated while being still with the car, making the engine make a good noise.<br />
Then the traffic light was green, she released the clutch smoothly and accelerated, continuing to drive home.<br />
Littletato was so happy to drive that car around the city, it was so beautiful and fast, it could reach more than 350 km/h (or 217 MPH).<br />
<br />
After some minutes of driving, she arrived home, parking the car in front of her house, accelerating it, and making noise, Julia got out of the house to see the new car.<br />
"It is so beautiful hon, I love this golden color it has, and it has a good sound!" said Julia, astounded and happy, smiling from ear to ear.<br />
"Thanks, hon, hehe," said Littletato, the music was still playing, Julia danced a little while listening to it, Littletato smiled and giggled a little.<br />
She lowered the volume and told Julia to grab the bags, saying please, she unlocked the right door of the car.<br />
Julia opened the right door and grabbed the bags, closing the door, and walking inside the house with them.<br />
Littletato grabbed her phone and her purse, putting on her earphones and plugging them on the phone, listening to the same song from before.<br />
She closed the door of the Lamborghini and pressed the alarm button on the car keys, locking the car.<br />
Then Littletato walked inside the house, closing the front door, she walked to the bedroom and changed herself.<br />
Julia was already eating the artificial chocolate that Littletato bought, "Already hon?" asked Littletato, looking at Julia.<br />
"I'm sowwy hon," said Julia with an innocent and sad face, "You're very gluttonous my sweetheart," said Littletato, hugging Julia and kissing her cheek.<br />
Julia smiled and continued biting her chocolate, "Give me one," said Littletato, biting the chocolate, "Of course honey, hehe," said Julia, kissing Littletato's lips.<br />
"When you're going to take me for a ride, hon?" asked Julia, "Tomorrow hon," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey," said Julia, hugging Littletato, it was eight PM, Littletato placed the car key on the wall key chain.<br />
"I bought two bottles of Coca-cola of three liters each.<br />
I also bought the artificial meat, sausages, and garlic bread, leave all but the bread in the freezer okay, honey?<br />
Tomorrow we'll wake up at eight AM and get them out of the freezer to season all but the garlic bread and the sausages," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey, hehe," said Julia, smiling, she stored her chocolate bar on the fridge and they started making dinner together.<br />
After some minutes, they finished making dinner, they ate together, then Littletato and Julia walked to the living room to watch some Yuru Camp anime episodes.<br />
They watched for a while and did their night necessities, then they walked to the bedroom and laid on the bed, hugging tight and sleeping.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 31/03/2019.<br />
And I finished revising it on 08/03/2021.<br />
No coincidences besides the month number today.<br />
<br />
It was very good to revise this chapter, I revised it while listening to the Yuru Camp anime soundtrack.<br />
And also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpNYYkXxT-A" target="_blank">"Take That" by RIOT</a>.<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpNYYkXxT-A" target="_blank" class="text_light_salmon text_hover_light_salmon">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpNYYkXxT-A</a><br />
I was very happy, talking about the coffee of Littletato and Julia, in the coffee shop where they first met.<br />
The relaxing bath of Julia and Littletato, Littletato and Julia playing games.<br />
The part where Littletato got a taxi to go get her car, and when she started driving it, it was so fun, with that song playing.<br />
I searched a lot of pictures of Lamborghini Aventador to see and feel that part of the story.<br />
It was so much fun, Littletato making noise with the car, and the kid talking about it, Littletato arriving at her neighborhood with her car, in style.<br />
The preparation for tomorrow's barbecue was also fun to write it.<br />
Thank you so much for reading this chapter :3.)

		It was a Sunday, Littletato woke up at six and a half AM, she got out of bed and did her morning necessities.<br />
She walked to the kitchen and removed the artificial meat and sausages out of the freezer.<br />
Littletato let the meats thaw for some minutes, then she got the cutting board and placed the artificial meat on top of it.<br />
The girl grabbed the salt and pepper, she sprinkled salt on the meat, making an even layer of salt.<br />
After that, Littletato ground fresh black pepper on the meat, she left the meat resting on a bowl at room temperature.<br />
She covered the meat with a napkin, then Littletato came back to bed, she hugged Julia and slept for some hours, but not more than two.<br />
Julia and Littletato woke up, Littletato looked at her phone, it was seven and forty AM, the couple did their morning necessities.<br />
Littletato grabbed a baking tray and placed the seasoned artificial meat on it, she also placed the artificial sausages.<br />
Julia grabbed the garlic bread, Littletato had bought a garlic-infused butter, Julia cut some slices of the garlic bread, then she passed the garlic butter on all of them.<br />
Then, Littletato grabbed the slices of garlic bread with butter, she placed them on the baking tray.<br />
She covered the baking tray with a napkin and waited for some minutes, the couple sat on the couch.<br />
After some minutes, Vitória arrived, Littletato opened the front door.<br />
Julia and Littletato greet Vitória, they smiled, Vitória had brought her barbecue grill, it was a gas grill.<br />
It had wheels to easy transportation, Vitória and Littletato brought the barbecue grill inside of the house.<br />
Littletato's house had a backyard on the laundry place, the laundry place had an open roof, they left the grill there.<br />
"I'm gonna let the grill heat for a while, did you prepared the meat, sausages, and garlic bread Littletato?" asked Vitória, turning the grill on.<br />
"Yes, they're resting on the kitchen, let me grab them," said Littletato, walking to the kitchen.<br />
"I'm gonna put some music on okay sis?" asked Julia.<br />
"Okay sis," replied Vitória, who was tidying up the grill.<br />
Then Julia walked to her bedroom, she grabbed her phone and turned its screen on.<br />
Julia put some good and energetic music to play on the Vegetify app, she had two Bluetooth speakers.<br />
Littletato removed the napkin from the top of the baking tray and brought it to Vitória.<br />
The barbecue grill was hot, Vitória left the baking tray on top of a table close to the barbecue grill.<br />
"Has Yam arrived yet?" asked Vitória, "Not yet," replied Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato heard a car stop at the front of her house, she came outside and saw that it was Yam.<br />
"Hey Littletato," said him, "Hello, Yam," replied Littletato.<br />
He closed his car and started walking towards Littletato, they both entered the house.<br />
Vitória walked to the kitchen, Julia and her said hello to Yam, he said hello back.<br />
He brought the artificial chicken already seasoned and placed it on top of the table.<br />
"Thanks, that's gonna save us a little time," said Littletato, noticing that the chicken was already seasoned, it was eight and forty AM.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato grabbed it and placed it on the baking tray in the laundry place.<br />
Vitória came back to the laundry place, she flipped some meat slices.<br />
"Do you want help with something, Littletato?" asked Yam.<br />
"Yeah, can you help Julia make the rice and beans?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Oh, okay," said Yam, then Julia and Yam started making the rice and beans, they started with rice.<br />
Littletato helped Vitória with the barbecue, she grabbed another baking tray to put the meats that were done.<br />
She grabbed a plate and placed some wheat flour into it, she grabbed a fork and grabbed a meat slice with it.<br />
The girl passed the meat in the wheat flour, she ate the slice and grabbed another one, passing it on the plate's flour again.<br />
Littletato brought it to Julia, giving it to her mouth, Julia said that it was delicious.<br />
Vitória continued flipping the slices of meat and the sausages slices, placing the done ones on the other baking tray.<br />
They were all happy, dancing with the playlist of happy songs that Julia put to play.<br />
Yam and Julia had finished making the rice, they prepared the table and placed the rice pan on top of it.<br />
Then they started making the beans, Littletato said that she was going to do the mayonnaise.<br />
She also put the two bottles of Coca-cola on the fridge, they were on the freezer.<br />
The four continued doing their things, after some time, the beans were done, the mayonnaise too.<br />
Vitória was almost finishing grilling the meats, sausages, garlic bread, and chicken.<br />
Littletato grabbed the first bottle of Coca-cola, placed it on top of the table, and opened it.<br />
Julia filled up four cups, she drank a little of her cup and brought one to Vitória.<br />
Vitória began drinking it, she also ate some slices of meat.<br />
After some time, Vitória finished grilling the things, she brought the baking tray to the kitchen table.<br />
The four started eating, Julia and Littletato sat side by side, Vitória and Yam too, it was ten AM.<br />
Julia and Littletato loved the meats, "This is delicious sis!" said Julia, smiling, Vitória said thanks while smiling too.<br />
The sausages and chicken were good, the rice and beans too, they all ate while drinking the Coca-cola.<br />
<br />
After some minutes, they finished eating, Vitória helped Julia wash the dishes, they stored the remaining meat, sausages, and chicken for dinner.<br />
Littletato and Yam walked to the living room, Littletato turned her Vbox One on, she opened a game called Overcooked 2.<br />
It was a game about cooking and delivering the cooked dishes, it was a coop game, it was funny and had challenging maps.<br />
One player had to give the ingredients and the other player had to get the ingredients and cook the dishes.<br />
Littletato grabbed one controller for Yam, they started playing, they laughed while playing, laughing about the things they got wrong, like throwing a dish at the sea.<br />
After some minutes, Vitória and Julia appeared there, they brought some meat slices and two cups of Coca-cola for Littletato and Yam.<br />
"Thanks, honey," said Littletato, "No problem," said Julia smiling.<br />
Yam said thanks to Vitória and she said no problem.<br />
Then Yam and Littletato continued playing Overcooked 2 while drinking Coca-cola and eating meat with forks.<br />
After a while, Vitória and Julia wanted to play too, Littletato grabbed two more controllers and gave them to them.<br />
The four played together, the game was good and funny, they laughed while playing it.<br />
Littletato was happy about the barbecue, it was very delicious, she loved to drink Coca-cola while eating barbecue.<br />
Julia was happy too, she liked to have Vitória and Yam there to spend some time with them.<br />
After playing for some time, it was eleven AM, Littletato was a little tired, Julia too, both of them stretched a little.<br />
"Hey guys, how about we go for a walk in the park?" asked Vitória.<br />
"Oh, that seems fun," replied Yam, smiling a little, "I have to stretch my legs for a while, so that's good," he continued.<br />
Then Littletato grabbed the controllers, she stored three of them on a part of the living room shelf, then she placed hers on top of the Vbox One.<br />
She turned the video game off and stretched a little, Yam grabbed his wallet, Vitória, Julia, and Littletato grabbed their purses.<br />
The four got out of the house, Littletato, and Julia in the front, Vitória behind Julia and Yam behind Vitória.<br />
Littletato locked the door and turned right, starting to walk in the direction where the park was.<br />
The three started walking together with Littletato, they got side by side with each other and began talking.<br />
"The barbecue was very great right?" asked Littletato, "Yes, it was very good honey, Vitória is a great cooker," said Julia, smiling, looking at Vitória.<br />
"Aw, thanks, you guys," said Vitória, smiling while blushing a little.<br />
"And the gaming session was very fun, why that game is so funny and good to play with friends?" asked Yam, curious.<br />
"I think it is because you can do wrong things in it, like throwing the food off or something," said Littletato, giggling a little.<br />
"And when you see your friend doing that, it is funny, and you laugh together," continued Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, I agree, hehe," said Yam, then they stayed silent for a moment.<br />
"Sundays are fun right, you have your day free, and you can do anything you want, it's good..." said Littletato, looking at the sky while walking.<br />
"Yeah, and you can do fun things, spend your day playing, go for a walk in the park," said Julia smiling, "Eat delicious foods," continued her, smirking while looking at Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Littletato with a genuine and innocent smile.<br />
They continued walking towards the park while looking at the scenery, the conversation died a little.<br />
"So... How your boyfriend is, Vitória? Is he doing alright?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, he's alright, but he is working today, he is a manager of a company, it's rare for him to work on Saturdays and Sundays, but it happens," said Vitória, looking a little sad.<br />
"Oh... I'm sorry," said Littletato, thinking that she ruined the mood.<br />
"No, it's okay Littletato," said Vitória, smiling again, "It's good to spend some time with you guys," continued her.<br />
<br />
Then they arrived at the park, Julia ran a little and jumped, she liked the park, so full of energy and fresh air.<br />
Littletato and Julia found a good place to sit, they sat below a tree which provided them a good shadow.<br />
The four sat down there, Littletato and Julia together, Vitória at the left side of Julia, and Yam at the left side of Vitória.<br />
They laid their heads on the ground, looking at the sky.<br />
"Sometimes is good to relax like this, spend some time just thinking and looking at nature," said Littletato, holding Julia's hand.<br />
"Yeah, I agree, sometimes we need to reconnect with nature, and feel the breeze and fresh air," said Vitória, who gave a relaxed sigh.<br />
The three sighed in unison, closing their eyes and relaxing for a while, feeling the breeze, the wind, and the fresh air they were breathing.<br />
After forty minutes laying there, relaxing, the four got up, they saw some kids playing Frisbee, they smiled at that.<br />
Littletato suggested for them to go home, it was mid-day, they started walking home while talking again.<br />
"We ate pretty early right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, I only said that I was going to arrive at eight AM because I thought that the barbecue was going to take some time to get done.<br />
I guess I wasn't confident enough in my skills, hehe," said Vitória, smiling a little.<br />
"Yeah, you're a very good cooker, sis," said Julia, smiling, Vitória said thanks while smiling too.<br />
Then after some minutes of walking, they arrived home, Littletato opened the door, Yam and Vitória sat on the couch.<br />
Littletato and Julia stretched a little, Littletato said that she was going to take a bath, Julia turned the Vbox One on.<br />
She logged into a spare account on the video game and gave the controller to Yam and another one to Vitória.<br />
Vitória and Yam started playing a little, they were playing a coop game called A Way Out.<br />
Julia entered the bathroom, Julia and Littletato started to take a bath together.<br />
<br />
"This game is fun, I wanted to play it since I watched it on Alanzoka's Vegetube channel," said Yam, smiling, he chose the character called Leo.<br />
"Oh, you know Alanzoka too?" asked Vitória, curious and a little surprised, "Yes, I watch his Livestreams every time that I can," replied Yam.<br />
"What is your favorite series of him?" asked Vitória.<br />
"I think it is the Far Cry Five one because that's how I knew about the game, and the game is very good," replied Yam.<br />
"Right? I love that game," said Vitória, smiling.<br />
"Me too, hehe," said Yam.<br />
Then they continued playing A Way Out, Vitória chose Vincent, cause he was the only character left to choose because Yam already had chosen Leo.<br />
Littletato and Julia finished bathing, they wore some clothes and got out of the bathroom, they walked to the living room and sat on the couch.<br />
They began to watch Yam and Vitória play for a while, it was one PM.<br />
"Hey, do you guys want afternoon breakfast?" asked Littletato to Yam and Vitória.<br />
"Oh, yes, please Littletato," said Yam, smiling.<br />
"I would like that a whole bunch," said Vitória.<br />
Then Vitória paused the game, she placed her controller close to the Vbox One console which was on top of the living room shelf.<br />
Yam did the same, the four walked to the kitchen, Yam and Vitória sat at the table.<br />
Littletato and Julia set up the table for them, they grabbed some slices of bread, butter, and cheese for them.<br />
They placed the cheese, butter, and bread on top of the table, they also grabbed some plates for them, and also a knife.<br />
Yam and Vitória grabbed two slices of bread each, they passed some butter and placed one cheese slice on them.<br />
Littletato and Julia made one cup of chocolate milk for Yam and one for Vitória.<br />
The couple made their meals and cups of chocolate milk, they sat at the table to eat.<br />
It was very delicious, it was good to eat with friends, they both ate while drinking too.<br />
After that, the four walked to the living room and sat on the couch, they played a little together, drinking water sometimes.<br />
Then, it was time for Yam and Vitória to go home, it was five PM, Littletato and Julia said goodbye to Yam and Vitória.<br />
Vitória placed her barbecue grill on the back of her car, she had an SUV.<br />
<br />
Julia hugged Vitória while giving goodbye to her, then they walked inside the house, Littletato logged out of the spare Vbox One account.<br />
She stored the spare controller and turned the video game off, Julia started to wash the dishes.<br />
Littletato drank some water, she walked to the kitchen and hugged Julia from behind, she kissed her neck.<br />
"That tickles honey, hehe," said Julia, smiling, "Hehe, the barbecue was very fun right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, the walk to the park, and playing with them," said Julia, washing the dishes, "I agree honey," said Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato helped her with the dishes, they both got out of the house, Littletato had the key of the car.<br />
She locked the front door of the house and walked to the car, unlocking it with a button on the car's key.<br />
Littletato entered the car and Julia too, Littletato got out of the parking lot and started driving through the city with her golden car.<br />
She drove fast so Julia could feel the speed of the car and feel the wind.<br />
"Whoa hon, you're going so fast, hehe," said Julia, smiling, she was having fun with the ride.<br />
Littletato stopped by a gas station to refill the tank of the car, then she continued driving around the city.<br />
"Hey honey, I think I want to do a trip with you with this car," said Littletato, driving.<br />
"A trip? To where hon?" asked Julia, looking at her, smiling.<br />
"To Texas, hehe, what do you think?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think it's a great idea hon, hehe, and you could go visit your aunt Luisa right?" asked Julia.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Littletato, driving.<br />

It was very delicious, it reminded them of the time they spent together with Yam and Vitória.<br />
Then, they finished eating, after that, they walked to the living room and sat on the couch.<br />

<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 14/04/2019.<br />
And finished revising it on 15/03/2021.<br />
<br />
It was good to revise, I just loved to write this chapter.<br />
I loved to write about barbecue, I searched about how to make meat and garlic bread for barbecue.<br />
I also loved to write about Yam arriving, him and Julia making the rice and beans, Littletato making the salad of artificial vegetables.<br />
The lunch that they had with the delicious barbecue, the walk to the park.<br />
The four talking while walking to the park, I began to see more of Littletato, and know more about her too, and how she acts and talks.<br />
I liked to write about Yam and Vitória playing together and their talk.<br />
About them making the afternoon breakfast, it reminds me of when I got to the house of my relatives, like my aunts and my grandma, and they serve afternoon breakfast for us.<br />
I loved to write about Littletato wanting to go to Texas, and her ride with Julia<br />
Anyway, thank you so much for reading this chapter, come again soon, hehe ^^.)

		It was a Thursday, Littletato was alone in her room, she had twelve years old and was playing some Vegecraft on her computer.<br />
She lived in the house of her parents, her father was called John, her mother was called Ana, they were very caring parents.<br />
Littletato thought she had a good life, she lived in Los Angeles with her parents and her sister Carol, Carol had ten years old.<br />
John had brown hair and Ana had blond hair, that is why Carol is blond and Littletato has brown hair.<br />
The girl was playing some Vegecraft, her father had a great house in Los Angeles, it had three bedrooms, a good bathroom, and a big kitchen.<br />
Carol had her room, Littletato too, but Carol liked to sleep with Littletato sometimes, they were very close sisters.<br />
Littletato wanted to be a traveler like her father, he traveled around cities to know his country a little more, and to know about other places.<br />
Sometimes John took her on a trip, she has been to Concord, Nevada City, and San Diego, she thought those were great cities.<br />
Her father bought her artificial chocolates, chips, and savory, she had fun on those trips.<br />
John taught her a lot of things about cars, motorcycles, and how to do a trip, how to prepare for a trip, Littletato liked to learn with her father.<br />
Carol also had a lot of attention from her parents, she wanted to work as a nutritionist, to teach people about food, and to also learn about food.<br />
She thought that we should think about what we eat and what that causes us and changes in our bodies.<br />
The girl liked to play video games and games on her computer, her father bought a Vbox 360 for both of them to play, it was in the living room.<br />
Carol liked to play with Littletato, they played a lot of games together and had fun.<br />
Littletato also had a brother called Ted, but he disappeared at a young age.<br />
She had a sister called Lisa too, she also disappeared at a young age.<br />

<br />
---<br />
<br />
It was a Monday, Littletato woke up, in the year 2019, it was April, she had nineteen years old Littletato got out of bed.<br />
She did her morning necessities, the girl was in the bathroom, brushing her teeth while looking at the mirror.<br />
Littletato thought that she did not take time off this year, she was thinking about going to Texas, remembering what she said to Julia yesterday.<br />
She walked to the bedroom and grabbed her stuff to take a bath, then the girl walked to the bathroom, she took a bath, it was five and a half AM.<br />
The girl walked to the kitchen, she grabbed the artificial ham and cheese, placed them on top of the table, and grabbed the bread, starting to make breakfast.<br />
Littletato grabbed two gray plates of porcelain, placed two slices of bread on each plate, cutting some ham, and grabbing a slice of cheese.<br />
She placed the slices of ham and cheese on top of the two slices of bread, closing the sandwiches.<br />
Then she made two cups of chocolate milk, one for her and one for Julia, she prepared the table, then walked to the bedroom to wake up Julia.<br />
Julia woke up and got out of bed, she did her morning necessities and walked to the kitchen to eat with Littletato.<br />
The couple ate and drank together while talking a little.<br />
"Hey honey, I think I'm gonna take a day off to travel to Texas with you, what do you think about that?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think that's good honey, are we gonna go with your golden car?" asked Julia, smiling.<br />
"Of course honey, hehe," replied Littletato, smiling.<br />
"We have to take a pic when we are on the way to post on the Vegesapp status, and also buy some chips, candies, savories, artificial chocolates, right hon?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, I love to eat those things while traveling, hehe, it reminds me of the time I traveled around California with my family.<br />
My cousins, friends, my dad, and my mom, I was traveling in a van, ah... Some good memories," said Julia, smiling while looking at the ceiling.<br />
"Yes, I want to travel with you hon," said Littletato, putting her hand above Julia's.<br />
"Me too hon, let's do it!" replied Julia, smiling.<br />
Then they finished eating breakfast, it was very good.<br />
<br />
After that, Littletato and her washed the dishes, Julia put her phone to charge in the bedroom.<br />
Littletato sent a message to the Vegesapp account of her work to say that she was going to take a day off.<br />
They replied saying okay and said that she was going to get paid, like a paid holiday.<br />
She smiled and turned her phone's screen off, it was six AM.<br />
"Hey honey, I'm gonna fill up the tank of the car, I think it was almost out of fuel yesterday," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey," said Julia, then Littletato grabbed the car keys and got out of the house, she locked the door.<br />
Littletato unlocked the car and entered inside it, turning it on, she started driving to the closest gas station.<br />
Julia started taking a bath, she thought of what Texas looked like, she has never been there, she thought about the foods they were going to eat on the trip.<br />
After some minutes, Littletato arrived at the gas station, she filled up the car's tank, she paid in debt using her credit card.<br />
Then, Littletato drove back to the house, she parked the car on the parking lot, getting out of it and locking it.<br />
Littletato unlocked the front door and entered the house, Julia had finished her bath, Littletato started hers.<br />
Julia was combing her hair, she was sat on the couch in the living room, she turned the Vbox One on to play some Titanfall 2.<br />
She liked that game, it was very fun and cool, Littletato was taking her relaxing bath.<br />
Then, Littletato was out of the bathroom, she changed herself and combed her hair, Julia closed the game and turned off the Vbox One.<br />
Littletato was ready, Julia too, she grabbed a Doritos pack and two cans of Coca-cola from the fridge.<br />
"Oh, honey, get a cooler for the cans, I think Texas is a little hotter than San Francisco," said Littletato.<br />
"Okay hon," said Julia, who grabbed the blue cooler and placed the two Coca-cola cans inside it, she walked to the bedroom and grabbed her phone, storing it in her pocket.<br />
Then she came back to the kitchen, Littletato gave the car keys to her, she got out of the house while holding the blue cooler.<br />
Julia unlocked the car and placed the blue cooler on the back seat.<br />
Then, Littletato grabbed two water bottles, one for her and one for Julia.<br />

They both put on their seat belts, Littletato turned the car on and got out of the parking lot, Julia programmed the GPS to go to Texas.<br />
Then, Littletato started driving around the city where the GPS told her, it was seven AM.<br />
<br />
After driving for some time, they got out of the city and were on a highway, Julia turned her phone on, she turned the Bluetooth on too.<br />
The girl put to play some highway and trip songs on Vegetify and connected her phone to the car's radio.<br />
Both of them danced and sang the songs while looking at the scenery and nature.<br />
The soundtrack of the Yuru Camp anime started playing, it had some country and nature style, it was very good.<br />
Julia and Littletato listened to it, it had an energetic banjo playing, they liked that kind of music.<br />
"I love this soundtrack hon!" said Julia, smiling.<br />
"Me too honey, hehe, I even try singing the ending of the anime sometimes," said Littletato smiling.<br />
"Are you hungry hon?" asked Julia.<br />
"Just a little, do you wanna open the Doritos packet?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, hehe," replied Julia, who grabbed the Doritos packet from the bag on her feet and opened it, she ate one Doritos.<br />
Then she brought one close to Littletato's mouth, Littletato opened her mouth and ate it.<br />
"So good, hehe, can you grab the cooler on the back hon?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Of course honey," replied Julia, then she grabbed the cooler from the back, placing it on her lap.<br />
She opened it and grabbed one can of Coca-cola, opening it, making a gas sound.<br />
Julia drank some sips of it and gave it to Littletato, she also drank some sips of it.<br />
"Refreshingly cold, hehe," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," said Julia.<br />
The couple was getting close to Los Angeles, they were eating Doritos and drinking Coca-cola, it was seven and forty AM.<br />
Littletato thought about buying more food and drinks in Los Angeles when they arrive there, she continued driving.<br />
<br />
Then, after driving for a while, Littletato and Julia arrived in Los Angeles by car, they paid for the toll.<br />
Upon entering the city, they saw the Hollywood big sign, it was beautiful to see.<br />
They continued driving around the city, Littletato looked for a gas station to refuel her golden Lamborghini.<br />
She found one and drove to it, stopped there, and refilled the tank of the car, she paid for the fuel.<br />
After that, Littletato began driving to a supermarket called Target, which is part of the Target supermarkets franchise.<br />
Littletato parked the car there, Julia got out of the car and placed the blue cooler on the back seat of the car.<br />
Then, Littletato locked the car, the couple began walking inside the supermarket.<br />
"Let's buy some biscuits, chips, and some drinks okay hon?" asked Littletato to Julia.<br />
"Okay hon," replied Julia.<br />
Then they started walking to the grocery and sugary food part of the supermarket.<br />
Littletato grabbed some Take 5 artificial chocolate bars, one Hershey's Dark, Kit Kat, and some Hershey's Classic.<br />
The chocolate bars were all artificial.<br />
She also grabbed some Lay's, Doritos, Cheetos Crunchy, and Milka Choco Cookies.<br />
Julia walked to the refrigerators, she grabbed one bottle of Coca-cola of 2 liters, then she walked back to Littletato.<br />
The girl placed the bottle of Coca-cola on the plastic basket that Littletato was holding.<br />
"Do you want anything else, hon?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think not, maybe some compostable cups," replied Julia.<br />
"Okay hon," said Littletato, who walked to another place in the supermarket, she grabbed a packet of compostable cups and placed it on the plastic basket.<br />
Then the couple walked to the cashier, they placed the products on the cashier's conveyor belt.<br />
After that, the cashier bagged up the products, Littletato paid for the purchase and grabbed the bags along with Julia.<br />
They walked to the car, Littletato unlocked the car and they entered inside it, Julia left some of the bags on her feet.<br />
Littletato turned the car on and started driving around LA, seeing the city.<br />
Julia took some pictures of the city with her phone, sending them to the Vegesapp status.<br />
Vitória, Julia's sister, said that she wanted to be there, enjoying Los Angeles, and eating all that good food.<br />
She wished Julia a safe and good trip, Julia said thanks with a smiley emoji.<br />
Then Littletato continued driving, Julia programmed the GPS to go to Texas, she saw that they were going to pass inside Flagstaff.<br />
Julia opened the packet of Lay's, she ate some and gave some in Littletato's mouth.<br />
The couple was listening to the "Yuru Camp" soundtrack.<br />
It was so much fun making a trip around the country, eating good food, and drinking delicious drinks, it was eight and forty-five AM.<br />
<br />
Littletato drove a little more, they both ate some Lay's, Doritos, and drank some cups of the Coca-cola bottle using the compostable cups.<br />
The Coca-cola was a little cold because it was on the cooler, it was nine AM, the sun was not too hot, it was on the left of Littletato and Julia.<br />
Julia looked at the scenery of that place, close to Flagstaff, the roof of the car was open, a lot of beautiful cars passed by, it was a two-lane highway.<br />
Littletato liked to hear the Yuru Camp soundtrack while driving, it was very fun, the car had an air conditioner if needed.<br />
After driving for some time, Littletato arrived at Flagstaff, she drove around the city, following the path that the GPS told her.<br />
She got out of the city and continued driving, her next stop was Gallup in New Mexico.<br />
There were some beautiful terrains on the highway they were in, Julia took some pictures of the road with her phone, posting them on her Vegesapp status, she had mobile data.<br />
Littletato was happy about driving her car on a highway, it was very good and relaxing.<br />
The next adventures of Littletato will continue on the next chapter, tune in tomorrow for more chapters!<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 05/05/2019.<br />
And finished revising it on 03/04/2021.<br />
<br />
It was very good revising this chapter, I loved it.<br />
It was good writing about the childhood of Littletato, how she lived with her parents and her sister.<br />
And how she was with her sister when she was eleven years old.<br />
The fact that Littletato got her passion for traveling from her father.<br />
The blue cooler that they got to store the cans and the bottle of Coca-cola, reminded me of the Over The Hedge movie.<br />
And also reminded me of the American culture of beers and cans and coolers, chips, sodas, all that stuff.<br />
I liked writing about them buying the various chips, chocolates, and other stuff to eat.<br />
I searched on the Internet for famous chocolate, biscuits, and chip brands of the United States.<br />
I opened Google Maps to look for the route from San Francisco to Texas, it is a one-day trip by car, and it takes five hours and twenty-five minutes by plane.<br />
And I also liked listening to the Yuru Camp soundtrack while revising this chapter.<br />
Thank you for reading! Hehe ^^.)

		The adventures of Littletato's trip to Texas continue, thank you for tuning in again in our channel.<br />
Littletato was still driving to Texas, Julia and she were listening to Yuru Camp's soundtrack on the car's radio.<br />
Some people looked at Littletato's car with amazement in their eyes, they had never seen a car so beautiful as that.<br />
The girl continued driving, following the GPS, Vitória sent a message to Julia on her Vegesapp, asking where they were right now.<br />
Julia replied her saying that they just left Flagstaff and are going towards Gallup in New Mexico.<br />
Vitória replied saying okay, she said that she was working, making a new logo for a company that sells compostable cups and dishware.<br />
Then, Julia replied saying that it was cool and that she wanted to see the logo when it is finished, Vitória replied by saying okay.<br />
After that, Julia opened the camera of her phone, she started recording the trip, and also Littletato driving.<br />
They were having fun on that trip, Littletato drove more, she wanted to stop by a gas station on Gallup to put some gasoline.<br />
Julia was happy by traveling with Littletato, after some minutes of driving, they arrived at Gallup.<br />
Littletato stopped by a gas station to put some gasoline, she paid for it with debt, using her credit card.<br />
Then she began driving again, around Gallup, Littletato drove close to a flea market, she stopped the car there and got out of it with Julia.<br />
Julia and Littletato began walking around the market, they saw some taco and some artificial burgers, some pies and stews, they wanted to eat that.<br />
The couple walked close to the taco stand, they asked for two tacos, two sodas, and some Navajo burgers.<br />
After that, they sat at a table to wait, they waited for a while, Julia sent a message to her sister saying that they were in Gallup now.<br />
Then, Littletato did the same for her sister.<br />
Littletato took a picture of the flea market of Gallup, after some minutes, their order arrived, the manager of the stand brought the food to them.<br />
They started eating the tacos and drinking the Vepsi soda, it was delicious, they loved the taste of the taco.<br />
Julia thought it was very good, she liked the taste of the dough, they finished eating the taco.<br />
After that, the couple started eating the Navajo burgers that used artificial meat hamburgers while drinking the soda.<br />
Then, they finished eating, it was very delicious, they paid for the food and continued walking around the flea market.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Julia walked for some minutes, then they walked back to the car, Littletato started driving around Gallup.<br />
The GPS told her to go to a road in Gallup to get out of it and continue her trip to Texas.<br />
Julia took a picture of the flea market and posted it on her Vegesapp status.<br />
Littletato and Julia were happy about the trip, they liked eating those tacos, burgers, and soda.<br />
They still had a lot of chips, chocolates, savory, and sweet biscuits, they did not want those because they were full.<br />
Littletato was out of Gallup, she continued driving towards Texas, looking at the GPS.<br />
The next city they were going to was Albuquerque in the state of New Mexico.<br />
Julia hugged Littletato and smiled, Littletato thought about the trips she did with her dad around the country.<br />
She thought that they were very fun, she enjoyed them, she also thought about her childhood and when she played games with Carol.<br />
"Do you want to sleep a little hon?" asked Littletato, it was nine and a half AM.<br />
"No, I'm fine honey, don't worry," replied Julia, kissing Littletato's cheek.<br />
"Okay then, hehe," said Littletato, smiling, with her hands on the steering wheel, the car was on automatic mode.<br />
Then, Julia laid her head on Littletato's right arm, she closed her eyes and gave a relaxed sigh.<br />
Littletato caressed Julia's hair a little, feeling the softness of it, "Aww, you can sleep here if you want hon," said Littletato smiling.<br />
"Hmm... Okay hon, thanks," said Julia in a sleepy voice.<br />
Then Julia began sleeping, Littletato continued driving to Albuquerque.<br />
She arrived there and passed through it, continuing the trip, the next city was Edgewood.<br />

<br />
The girl arrived in Texas, Julia was awake, she drove to Houston, the biggest city of Texas, she began driving around the city.<br />
Houston had a chocolate bar population, there were all kinds of chocolate bars there.<br />
Black chocolate, white chocolate, some different ones like a black diamond one, a Kit Kat, and milk chocolate.<br />
Julia and Littletato were happy to see the city, it looked good, they read that the city was very hot in the summer and cold in the winter.<br />
Littletato continued driving around the city, then she parked the car close to some shops, she wanted to see the things they sold.<br />
They walked to a clothes shop, the saleswoman of the clothes shop walked close to them to talk, she said her name was Layla, she had nineteen years old.<br />
"Hey, you guys aren't from here right?" asked Layla with a smile on her face.<br />
"Yes, we aren't, we're just here to visit, I'm Littletato," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, nice to meet you Littletato.<br />
There aren't many vegetable people around here, that's we know that they are tourists.<br />
The mayor of this city moved here with his family, other people moved too, it became a city.<br />
Take a look around the city, it is very good, I like living here," said Layla.<br />
"Okay, we're gonna take a look, thanks, hehe," replied Julia, smiling.<br />
"No problem, hehe, are you guys a couple? Sorry for asking..." asked Layla.<br />
"Yes, we are, and don't worry," replied Littletato smiling.<br />

She drove some more, Julia began eating the Doritos packet and began drinking a cup of Coca-cola.<br />
After that, Littletato asked for some Cheetos Crunchy, Julia gave some on her mouth, she ate them and drank one cup of Coca-cola.<br />
There was some country music playing on the car's radio, Julia liked that genre of music, it reminded her of home.<br />

After some minutes of driving, they arrived at the Memorial City Mall, Littletato parked the car on the mall's parking lot, they got out of the car and Littletato locked it.<br />
They entered the mall and began walking around it, looking at the stores.<br />

They were amazed by seeing so many beautiful things, they loved technology, mainly Littletato.<br />
Littletato bought a good wireless headphone, she was going to pay for it in debt using her credit card.<br />
Julia began walking around the store, she looked at the games on the games shelf, she had some experience in organizing products for customers because of her work.<br />
So she loved the way that the games were organized on the shelf, they were appealing and looked cool there.<br />
She was looking at the Vbox One games shelf, there were Titanfall 2, Overcooked 2, Grand Theft Auto V, and Far Cry 5.<br />
Littletato was paying for the headphones, she paid and walked to where Julia was.<br />
"Do you want to buy any games hon?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, I think we never played GTA five right?" asked Julia.<br />
"Yes, do you wanna buy it?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes honey," replied Julia.<br />
"Okay, hehe," said Littletato, who grabbed Grand Theft Auto V for Vbox One and placed it inside a plastic basket.<br />
Julia smiled while looking at Littletato, then she walked around the store, she grabbed one wireless earbud and placed it inside the plastic basket.<br />
Then Littletato and Julia walked back to the counter, Littletato paid for the purchase, they got out of the store.<br />
Littletato unlocked the car, placed the bag on the back seat of the car, then she sat on the driver's seat.<br />

"Yes, I'm gonna call her, what is your name?" asked the woman.<br />
"Littletato," replied Littletato.<br />
Then the woman walked to the deposit, the clothes store did not have any customers at that time, so Layla could talk a little.<br />
Layla appeared there, saying hi, Littletato said hi back, they got outside.<br />
"So, we're gonna go back home," said Littletato, "And we wanted to say goodbye to you," continued her.<br />
"Oh, where do you guys live?" asked Layla.<br />

"I think it is a good idea hon, hehe, do you want female or male?" asked Julia, smiling.<br />
"I think I want female hon, hehe," replied Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey, hehe," said Júlia.<br />
Then they slept in the cold night, hugging tight.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 26/05/2019.<br />
I finished revising this chapter on 08/04/2021.<br />
<br />
It was very good to write it, the continuation of Littletato's trip to Texas.<br />
It was good to plan the route, open up a map website to check which cities existed between San Francisco and Texas.<br />
And I didn't know that Texas was a state and not a city.<br />
I always thought that it was a city.<br />
It was good to write about Littletato and Julia buying clothes and electronics.<br />
And about them eating in the restaurant, I searched on the Internet for how a waiter speaks in restaurants.<br />
I also searched for American restaurant menus to see what they serve, it was good to write that Littletato and Julia ate all of those delicious artificial meats.<br />
It was good to write about Littletato and Julia meeting Layla and adding her to their Vegebooks.)

		<h4 id="chapter_24_text" class="text_size unselectable" style="text-align: left;">
		It was the day twenty-four of June of 2019, a Friday, Littletato lived in San Francisco, she was lying in bed.<br />
Julia was lying beside her, Littletato was thinking about adopting a dog.<br />
She wanted a female dog, she was awake, Julia was not.<br />
Littletato grabbed her phone, opened DuckDuckGo, the search engine that she uses, and searched for how to adopt a dog.<br />
The girl read some articles on the Internet about how to adopt a dog, she learned a lot about the subject.<br />
It was six AM, Littletato got out of the bed, walked to the bathroom, and did her morning needs.<br />
After that, Littletato walked to the kitchen, she prepared breakfast and ate, she left Julia's breakfast there on the table.<br />
Littletato walked to the living room, she saw a light-blue ball floating some centimeters above the ground, it looked like an energy ball.<br />
She touched the ball, and then everything was gone, she looked around and there was nothing.<br />
The floor in which she stepped was white and had her shadow, and the background of that place was white too.<br />
It looked like that place was infinite, Littletato could walk around it and she would not find an end for it.<br />
Then, she woke up, that was a dream, a very weird dream, then, Littletato got out of bed, she sighed and walked to the kitchen.<br />
She looked at the table, Julia's breakfast was there, exactly how she left on that dream, she thought that was weird.<br />
After that, Littletato walked to the living room, there was no light-blue ball of energy on the carpet.<br />
Littletato walked to the front door, she opened it and walked outside, her house was floating in space.<br />
She wondered why she could breathe there, if there is no air there, there was another house close to Littletato's, and there was a road to get to there.<br />
The girl walked to the house, she entered inside it, there was a couple watching movies in the living room while sitting on the couch.<br />
Littletato could know that the name of the girl was Monika and that the name of the boy was Ted.<br />
Their house looked like a squared spaceship, it had white walls, a blue bathroom-box-like thing on the corner of the living room, the LST letters were written on it.<br />
After that, Littletato walked to their kitchen, Ted and Monika could not see Littletato.<br />
Littletato opened their fridge, it had the TPF letters written on it, she saw a piece of cake there, a packet of Doritos and one can of Coca-cola.<br />
Then, Littletato woke up again, she sat on the bed, it was five and a half AM.<br />
She started walking to the kitchen, "If I see the breakfast again, I swear I'll..." said her.<br />
Littletato did not saw Julia's breakfast on the table, she sighed in relief.<br />
<br />
The girl walked to the bathroom, she did her morning needs, took a bath, brushed her teeth, and combed her hair.<br />
After that, she walked to the kitchen, Littletato did breakfast for her and Julia, she walked to the bedroom.<br />
Littletato saw Julia's phone charging on the wall socket, she woke up Julia.<br />
Julia walked to the bathroom and started doing her morning needs, Littletato walked outside to make sure she was not in a dream.<br />
Then she walked inside again, locking the door, she walked to the kitchen and sat at the table.<br />
After that, Julia finished doing her morning needs, she walked to the kitchen and sat at the table to eat breakfast.<br />
The couple ate breakfast while talking a little.<br />
"Hey honey, I had a really weird dream last night," said Littletato.<br />
"Oh, what happened on that dream hon?" asked Julia.<br />
Then Littletato explained to Julia what happened in her dream, Julia thought that it was weird.<br />
She also had another dream, one about a dog with yellow fur sitting on her lap.<br />
"Also, I read about how to adopt a dog on the Internet, I learned a lot.<br />
And I'm gonna start preparing the house to adopt the dog next month, okay?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay hon, hehe," said Julia.<br />
They finished eating breakfast, Littletato prepared herself to go to work, Julia gave goodbye to her, it was six AM.<br />
Littletato started walking to work, she arrived there and sat at her table, she started fixing errors on an app.<br />
Mia helped her fix the errors, she was having a hard time fixing a specific error.<br />
<br />
Julia stretched a little, she drank some sips of her bottle of water and stored it in the fridge again, it was six and a half AM.<br />
Then she walked to the computer room, turning Littletato's computer on, she walked to the bedroom.<br />
She grabbed her phone that was charging on the wall socket, removing the charger.<br />
Julia opened the gallery app on her phone and looked at some pictures of her and Littletato.<br />
The girl remembered the trip to Texas that she and Littletato made some months ago.<br />
She remembered that her sister Vitória sent her the image of the logo that she made for that compostable dishware company.<br />
Julia smiled while looking at the pictures, the picture of the New Year's Eve of 2019.<br />
After that, Julia walked to the computer room, she locked the screen of her phone and left it on top of the table.<br />
She sat at the chair of Littletato's computer, putting on the on-ear wireless headphones that Littletato bought on the trip to Texas.<br />
Julia thought about Layla, the girl that she and Littletato met in Texas, she is a very good friend, Julia talks with her sometimes on Vegebook.<br />
Then, Julia logged in to her Windows account on Littletato's computer, she opened the Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare to play the Warzone mode of it.<br />
She played some matches of it, she was very good and had made many kills, it was seven AM.<br />
Julia was a little tired of playing, she stretched a little and closed the game, she also closed the GamePlayer.py Python script.<br />
It was a Python script that Littletato made to count how much time she spent playing a game.<br />
Julia played COD: MW on Warzone mode for one hour, she put a song to play on Vegecloud and got up.<br />
She walked to the kitchen to drink water, listening to the song on the wireless headphones.<br />
It was so good to be able to listen to music from far away without having to be on the computer.<br />
She drank some sips of her water bottle, then she stored it in the fridge again.<br />
<br />
Julia wanted to go out for a walk, she needed to stretch her body a little.<br />
She turned the computer off and left the wireless headphone charge on its stand.<br />
After that, Julia changed herself, she grabbed her phone, her wireless earbuds, and her bottle of water.<br />
Julia got out of the house, locked the front door, and turned left, starting to walk to the park of San Francisco.<br />
Then, the girl put her wireless earbuds on, she put a song to play on Vegetify on her phone.<br />
She continued walking to the park, listening to the country songs that were playing on the playlist that she put to play.<br />
After walking for some time, Julia arrived at the park, she was a little tired and sat on a bench to rest.<br />
Julia rested while looking at nature and listening to the calm songs on her playlist, it was eight and thirty AM.<br />
Littletato sent a message to her on Vegesapp asking how she was.<br />
Julia replied saying that she was good, and that she has gone for a walk, that she is at the park right now.<br />
Littletato replied saying that it was cool, she said that she finished making the front end of an app, Julia said that it was cool.<br />
Then Julia locked the screen of her phone, she got up and started walking back home again.<br />
She arrived there, unlocked the door, and entered the house.<br />
Julia drank some sips of her bottle of water and stored it in the fridge, she left her phone charging.<br />
It was nine AM, Julia locked the front door of the house, she took a bath.<br />
After that, she made a sandwich and a cup of chocolate milk for her to eat and drink.<br />
She ate and drank, then she prepared herself for work, it was nine and a half AM.<br />
Julia changed herself, she grabbed her phone and stored it in her pocket, she also grabbed her purse with some money.<br />
The girl walked outside, locking the front door, she called a taxi and entered it, telling the driver where she wanted to go.<br />
After that, the driver started driving to Julia's workplace, he drove for some minutes and arrived there.<br />
<br />
Julia paid for the ride and got out of the taxi, saying thanks.<br />
She walked to the Safeway supermarket, entering it.<br />
After that, Julia prepared herself for work, her supervisor told her to go to hall number eight to organize some shelves.<br />
Julia walked there, there was another worker there, he and Julia worked together to organize the shelves.<br />
She knew how to organize the shelves and refill them with the new products that arrived, she organized them in a way that appealed to consumers.<br />
Then, she walked back to hall number three, her supervisor was there.<br />
He asked her to grab the new artificial meats and chicken from the deposit, and place them on the refrigerators on hall number four, close to the soda refrigerators.<br />
Julia grabbed the pallet of meats with the help of the forklift, she moved the pallet to hall number four.<br />
Then, Julia started stocking the refrigerators, putting the artificial meat and chicken packets on them.<br />
After that, Julia worked a little more, it was mid-day, she took a break to eat lunch.<br />

<br />
It was good to write about the weird dream of Littletato.<br />
And writing about Julia and her talking about adopting the dog.<br />
Julia playing a little, using GamePlayer to register her gaming time, catching a taxi to go to work.<br />
About her working and doing her job, I searched up on the Internet on how to stock supermarket shelves to write that part.<br />
I also liked to write about the conversation of Julia and Littletato while eating dinner, about they talking about their days at work.<br />
I loved to write the little part of The Life of Bigbeet story, chapter number five.<br />
I am Brazilian, and I like to write about Brazilians. xD<br />
Hehe, I get happy seeing how Claudia and Sasha love each other, it makes me feel comfortable and secure.<br />
As if I was Sasha, I liked to search on the Internet for nicknames for moms and daughters.<br />
I liked mumsy, sweetheart, sweetie, mommy, mammy, okaasan, and other ones.<br />
Thank you for reading, hehe, I loved to write this chapter.<br />
I like when a certain reader reads The Life of Littletato. xD<br />
She has been reading Littletato very fast, hehe, like, three chapters per day.<br />
And I love to receive the read notification of her on a social network.<br />

Lisa began walking around the laundry place, getting familiar with her new home.<br />
Then, she drank some water and ate some food.<br />
Julia grabbed her on her torso and began caressing her fur, "She is so cute and soft hon, hehe," said Julia, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," replied Littletato, then Julia left her on the floor.<br />
Littletato also had bought a dog pee pad, she would have to train the dog on how to use it.<br />
After that, Julia and Littletato left the laundry place, they closed the door.<br />
Julia and Littletato began making dinner together, they made fried artificial meat, some artificial salad, and rice and beans.<br />
They ate together, the food was delicious, after that, they washed the dishes together.<br />
Littletato saw Lisa eating some food, she smiled while looking at that.<br />
After that, Littletato and Julia walked to the bedroom to sleep, they laid on the bed.<br />
The couple began sleeping, they were hugging tight while using the blanket.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Julia woke up after sleeping for eight hours, they walked to the bathroom and did her morning necessities.<br />
After that, Julia began preparing the breakfast, it was a Thursday, Littletato opened the laundry place door that was made of glass.<br />
She grabbed Lisa on her torso, Lisa licked her face, "Good morning, Lisa," said Littletato in a voice that you would speak to a baby.<br />
Lisa wagged her tail and opened her mouth, it was like she was smiling, Littletato was happy, it was six AM.<br />
Then, Littletato left Lisa on the floor, she got out of the laundry place and closed its door.<br />
Julia had finished preparing breakfast, Littletato and Julia ate together.<br />
"What do you think hon? About having Lisa," asked Littletato.<br />
"I think it is very good, something to bring more happiness to us, hehe, and she's very cute and fluffy," said Julia, smiling.<br />
"I think so too, hehe," said Littletato, also smiling.<br />
Then they finished eating breakfast, Julia and Littletato washed the dishes, after that, Littletato walked to the bedroom to prepare herself for work.<br />
Littletato finished preparing herself, she walked to the front door, saying bye to Julia with a kiss on her lips.<br />
Julia said bye back, then Littletato got out of the house and locked the front door, she got her car to go to work.<br />
After some minutes of driving, Littletato arrived at her workplace, she parked her car and locked it, entering the building and walking to her desk.<br />
She sat at her desk and turned her computer on, Mia said hello to her, Littletato said hello back.<br />
"How is your day going?" asked Mia from the other desk.<br />
"It is going good, what about yours?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Good too, thanks for asking, hehe, any news?" asked Mia.<br />
"I adopted a female dog, hehe, her name is Lisa," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that's cool, can you send me a picture of her at lunchtime?" asked Mia.<br />
"I didn't take pictures of her yet, you gotta wait until I am home," replied Littletato.<br />
"Okay, hehe," said Mia.<br />
Then Littletato began fixing the errors in an app, it was a dating app that the Interworks Technologies company was paid to make.<br />
After some minutes of fixing errors, the boss of Littletato sent a message to her on the messaging app that the company had made.<br />
Her boss told her that she needed to make a system for the workers to register what they have done.<br />
Littletato downloaded the plan of the system that her boss sent her.<br />
Then, she began coding (making) the app while following the plan, it was seven AM.<br />
<br />
After some hours working, it was mid-day, Julia was already working on the Safeway supermarket.<br />
Littletato and Julia stopped to eat during their lunch breaks.<br />
They had bought a packed lunch from home to eat while working.<br />
Julia and Littletato ate their packed lunches, it was very delicious.<br />
Then, they continued working, Littletato was thinking about Lisa, wondering if she was good and safe at home.<br />
If she was hungry or thirsty, Littletato continued working, making the system made to register the work that workers do.<br />
After some hours, it was six PM, it was time to go home, Julia prepared herself to go home.<br />
She got out of the supermarket and got a taxi to go back home.<br />
The girl arrived at home and unlocked the front door, she entered the house and locked it.<br />
Julia walked to the bedroom and left her purse there, she left her phone charging on the wall socket.<br />
"Lisa, I'm back," said Julia, walking to the laundry place, she opened the door and grabbed Lisa on her torso.<br />
"I missed you so much Lisa, hehe," said Julia, caressing Lisa's fur, Lisa licked her face, Julia smiled.<br />
Then Julia left Lisa on the floor, she locked the door of the laundry place and walked to the bathroom to take a bath.<br />
Littletato was in her car, driving back home, she passed by the supermarket to buy some stuff.<br />
She bought two bottles of Coca-cola and some Doritos, then she walked back to the car, driving home again.<br />
<br />
After some minutes of driving, Littletato arrived home, she got out of the car and unlocked the front door.<br />
Littletato grabbed the bags of the supermarket and walked inside the house, placing the bags on top of the kitchen table.<br />
She heard the shower, and noticed that Julia was taking a bath, Littletato walked out of the house and locked the car.<br />
Then she walked back inside again, locking the front door, she stored the two bottles of Coca-cola on the fridge.<br />
Julia got out of the bathroom, she has finished her bath, "Oh, you're here, hon, I'll start doing dinner while you take a bath okay?" asked Julia.<br />
"Okay honey, hehe, but first, I gotta say hello to this cuteness," said Littletato, walking to the laundry place and opening the door.<br />
"Hehe," said Julia, smiling while looking at Littletato, Littletato grabbed Lisa on her torso and caressed her fur, smiling.<br />
After that, Littletato left Lisa on the floor, she locked the door and walked to the bathroom.<br />
Littletato started taking her bath, Julia started making dinner.<br />
Then, after some minutes, they both finished doing their things, Littletato got out of the bathroom.<br />
Julia sat at the table to eat, Littletato did that too, they began eating dinner.<br />
"How was your day at work hon?" asked Julia.<br />
"It was very good hon, I talked with Mia there, I told her that we adopted a dog.<br />
She asked me to send a picture of Lisa to her, hehe," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Oh, hehe, why don't you take one right now then? After we finish eating," asked Julia.<br />
"Okay hon, hehe," replied Littletato.<br />
"How was your day at work?" asked Littletato, emphasizing the "your".<br />
"It was very good, hehe, I helped an old woman to find the hygiene aisle. and stocked up some shelves, hehe," replied Julia, smiling.<br />
"That's good hon, hehe," said Littletato, smiling too.<br />
Then they finished eating, Littletato and Julia washed the dishes together, they walked to the living room.<br />
Littletato turned the TV on and changed to the Vegeflix app to watch a series.<br />
The couple watched some episodes of the SpaceLiving series, a series that showed how the teens of the SpaceLiving Network lived there.<br />
It showed the life of the teens that were residents of the SpaceLiving Network, a network of spaceships that hovered in space.<br />
Littletato and Julia thought that it was a very interesting series, they wanted to live on one spaceship of those.<br />
After that, the couple was a little tired, they watched two episodes of that series, Littletato turned the TV off.<br />
They both brushed their teeth, Julia walked to the bedroom and laid in the bed, Littletato walked to the laundry place to check if Lisa had food and water.<br />
Littletato then walked to the bedroom, she laid on the bed with Julia, hugging her tight, they began sleeping.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this chapter on 02/07/2019.<br />
I finished revising this chapter on 22/04/2021.<br />
<br />
Then the ending of the "No ekisaitinguna seikatsu Littletato [Littletatoのエキサイティングな生活]" (The exciting life of Littletato) anime plays.<br />
I loved to revise this chapter, I loved writing about Littletato adopting the dog, and her name being Lisa.<br />
Maybe that's a reference to a chapter of The Life of Littletato 7w7.<br />
Or a reference to another story of mine, I don't know, hehe 7w7 (smirk).<br />
I read a lot about adopting a dog on the Internet to write this chapter.<br />
And I liked to write about Mia and Littletato's conversation.<br />
I think I've never written Mia talking inside quotes and stuff.<br />
Hehe, I liked writing about Julia and Littletato caressing Lisa and giving her love, missing her. :3<br />
I also liked writing about Littletato and Julia watching that series on Vegeflix, the SpaceLiving Network series.<br />
Maybe SpaceLiving is another story of mine, I don't know, hehe.<br />
<br />
Old notes of the author, written on 02/07/2019:<br />
(This is not how I see Littletato, how I see her is being shown on the website picture and the chapter covers)<br />
Well, it was cool to write this chapter, I changed the title.<br />
I inserted a title instead of doing just "chapter 1" and 2 and 3.<br />
This way I can remember easily what happened in the chapter instead of saying just "the dreamland chapter" or "the Texas trip chapter".<br />
I wrote this piece listening to SubCarbon Records Soundcloud profile, and... I just wanted to say that to you guys. :3<br />
Also, this is how I imagine Littletato (ignore the dogs), a really shy girl. xD)<br />

<br />
It was a Friday, in the year 2020, Littletato slept with Julia.<br />
After some time, it was midnight on Saturday, Littletato was sleeping along with Julia, she was laying in bed.<br />
She was having a weird dream, a dream about her getting teleported to a spaceship called LonelyShip.<br />
It had a super fast and powerful computer, it was white, a PlayVegestation 4 gaming console, a bed, and a wardrobe.<br />
The spaceship had white walls inside and out, the computer of the spaceship had a modified version of Windows 10 installed on it.<br />
It was called Windows 10 (SpaceLiving Edition).<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_salmon border_radius_6_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/LonelyShip Story Cover.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
The bed had a blue blanket, the bed was made of some resistant plastic that was light gray, and the wardrobe was gray too.<br />
It also had a Laser Turret outside of it, it could shoot a laser beam to hit approaching asteroids.<br />
The Laser Turret had two modes, the Expanded Range mode, and the Shielded mode.<br />
The Expanded Range mode made it possible for the Laser Turret to shoot asteroids that were in a place that was hard to aim.<br />
The Shielded mode made it possible for the Laser Turret to cover itself with a shield to protect it from asteroids.<br />
Two tall windows to see the sun, the moon, and the Earth, an ergonomic chair with casters, adjustable armrests, height, and back.<br />
The spaceship had also a bathroom, and sixteen turbines to move the spaceship when needed, they were deactivated by default.<br />
The LonelyShip could compress the bathroom to a small place.<br />
Making it possible to the resident of the LonelyShip to open the door of the bathroom and enter inside it, without making the spaceship too large.<br />
The bathroom existed in a type of space that did not occupy physical space, it was the width of the door.<br />
It had a teleporter that could teleport the resident of the spaceship between other spaceships and also to the Earth.<br />
The teleporter was called LonelyShip Teleporter, the initials were LST and were written on the upper part of its plastic frame, the LST was blue.<br />
That teleporter did not exist in older versions of the LonelyShip.<br />
The wardrobe had four doors and was on the right of the LST teleporter.<br />
There was also a fridge that could create any food you thought of, it was called the Thought-Powered Fridge or TPF, the TPF was blue.<br />
It was on the left of the computer chair, and at the right of the left window.<br />
The fridge made foods and drinks that were only nutrients, for example, a slice of pizza.<br />
That slice of pizza would have the smell, taste, and texture of a pizza, but would be just nutrients and vitamins that the resident needed.<br />
The TPF fridge would analyze the body of the resident and make a diet containing the nutrients and vitamins that the resident needs.<br />
Then it would split those nutrients that were needed for the whole day into three meals, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br />
If the resident wanted to eat more than three meals, the fourth and next meals would be only mass, not nutrients.<br />
Foods created by the TPF fridge did not have meat or animal products, they were vegan-friendly.<br />
Particles on the food could change the nutrients that are in it, but could not change the taste, smell, or texture, that was pre-built into the food.<br />
Littletato could know that the spaceship or LonelyShip had an Artificial Intelligence, an AI, that could help the residents of the spaceships manage their spaceships.<br />
The AI was called LonelyShip Artificial Intelligence, or LSAI for short.<br />
The LonelyShip also had four small signboards on its walls, two displaying "SpaceLiving", and another two displaying "LonelyShip" on the right of the SpaceLiving one.<br />
The SpaceLiving and LonelyShip signboards were equal on each side of the LonelyShip, one SpaceLiving one on each side, and one LonelyShip one on each side.<br />
The signboards on the left side were on the left of the window, and the right ones were on the right of the window.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_salmon border_radius_6_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/LonelyShip Story Cover Front Signboards.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
Also, the LonelyShip has two big signboards on the front side of it, one with "SpaceLiving" written on it, and another one with "LonelyShip".<br />
The SpaceLiving signboard is above the LonelyShip one.<br />
<br />
That spaceship, the LonelyShip, was part of a network of SpaceShips, the network was called the "SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network".<br />
A lot of other people lived inside the other spaceships, but Littletato did not know about that, the spaceships were not close enough for you to see one outside your window.<br />
The company that created those spaceships and the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network was called Think Outside The Box or TOTB for short.<br />
It created that spaceship network for teens that were depressed and sad about their lives, they did not have a will or a purpose to live for.<br />
The company teleported the depressed teens to the LonelyShips by teleporting them while they were sleeping.<br />
They were teleported to their LonelyShips, and they thought that it was a dream, then, the LSAI told them that they were not in a dream.<br />
After that, the teens asked if they could go back to Earth, the LSAI told them that they could go back.<br />
The computers of the LonelyShips also had the SpaceLiving Network app or program installed by default, for those who did not like to manage their LonelyShip with an AI.<br />
The residents of the SpaceLiving Network were called LonelyShippers or LonelySpaceShippers.<br />
They also asked what they could do there, and the LSAI explained what they could do there.<br />
If you live in a LonelyShip, you can ask the LSAI for anything, like changing wall colors, or removing and adding furniture.<br />
The Things Generator, a spectral machine or system that exists inside the LonelyShip, will create those things for you.<br />
It can also delete things that you do not want with its powerful laser beam.<br />
Some of the teens decided to stay there, and live a better life in the SpaceLiving Network, they thought they would have fun there.<br />
Using the computer, playing games, listening to music, watching anime, cartoons, series, movies, and videos.<br />
Some of them thought that it was bad to have to eat food, drink water, and sleep, they still needed to do that, but now they could do it easier.<br />
The TOTB company thought that they would live a better life on their spaceships.<br />
Littletato was dreaming about that spaceship, but it felt like she was there like she was teleported to that spaceship, everything was so real.<br />
She even felt like she was floating in bed while smiling before the dream started.<br />
The girl felt like some kind of light surrounded her while she felt that she was floating, she could know that the light was blue by feeling the light.<br />
<br />
Littletato woke up on the bed of the spaceship called LonelyShip, it had white walls, she could see everything that was inside it.<br />
She could see the two windows on each side of the spaceship, one on the left and one on the right.<br />
The girl could see the LST or LonelyShip Teleporter by her left, on the corner of the LonelyShip.<br />
Littletato could see the TPF or Thought-Powered Fridge, a wide desk for the computer, the chair, and the wardrobe.<br />
She got up and asked herself out loud, "Why am I here?"<br />
"You're here because we're taking a test in teens, to see if they would fit the SpaceLiving SpaceShip Network.<br />
And we teleported you here while you were dreaming because that's the best time to teleport someone to a spaceship.<br />
Don't worry, it's still night where you live, which is San Francisco, right?" asked the voice.<br />
"Also, sorry for not presenting myself, my name is Claudia, but you can change my name on the settings of the LonelyShip.<br />
I am an Artificial Intelligence, the LonelyShip Artificial Intelligence, or LSAI for short.<br />
I can help you manage the LonelyShip and do other things too," explained Claudia, the LSAI.<br />
"Hmm, her name is Claudia, how weird, the mother of Sasha from The Life of Bigbeet is also called Claudia..." Littletato thought to herself.<br />
"Oh, okay, I know about those things, TOTB, the things on the LonelyShip, and about who you are.<br />
And yes, I do live in San Francisco," replied Littletato.<br />
"So you just want to see if I would fit in here and would like to live here right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, exactly, we, TOTB, teleport teens to LonelyShips to live on them because they are sad and miserable, they are not happy with their lives.<br />
So we teleport them to a place where they can be happy, and do not need money to be happy or to survive," explained Claudia, the LSAI.<br />
"Okay, I'm gonna give this spaceship a try then," said Littletato, "Can you change your name to John?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, now I'm called John," said John, the LSAI, "Why do you want me to have that name?" asked him.<br />
"It's the name of my father, to remind me of him," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, okay," said John, the LSAI.<br />
<br />
Then, Littletato got out of the bed, she was looking at the speakers of the computer, the computer was off and the computer screen was black.<br />
She walked to the window, she could see the Earth and the moon, she walked to the other window on the right of the bed, she could see the sun.<br />
Littletato walked to the TPF fridge, she thought of a can of Coca-cola, then she opened the fridge, there was a can of Coca-cola there, and nothing else.<br />
The girl opened the can of Coca-cola, making a gas noise, she looked at the computer speakers while holding the can.<br />
"So, just to make sure, I can leave this spaceship right?" asked Littletato to John.<br />
"Yeah, you can, just enter the LST teleporter and select your address on the LST menu," explained John, the LSAI.<br />
"Okay..." said Littletato.<br />
"If you still have questions, you can contact a SpaceLiving Volunteer Helper on the official Discord server of the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
Do you want me to turn the computer on?" asked John.<br />
"Yes, please," replied Littletato.<br />
John turned the computer on, it booted up.<br />
Littletato saw the home screen of Windows 10 (SpaceLiving Version).<br />
The Discord program was open, she was asked to log into her Discord account to use it, she already had one.<br />
Littletato typed her email and password, pressing enter, she came across her normal Discord.<br />
But she received a Discord server invite from a user called Think Outside The Box, the company that created the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
A Discord server is like a group where you can spend time, you can create channels for different categories or topics of messages and posts.<br />
She clicked on it and entered the server, after that, John helped her find the chat room that listed the Volunteer Helpers of the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
Littletato chose a helper with the user name Lisa, she opened the direct message (DM) screen with Lisa to write her a message.<br />
"Hello, I am Littletato, a new LonelyShipper of the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
The LSAI explained the things to me, about the network and the LonelyShips.<br />
It said that I could add new things to my LonelyShip, and those things would appear from the inside of a wall.<br />
But I didn't understand that right, can you explain it to me, please?" asked Littletato in her message.<br />
"Oh, hello Littletato, I'm Lisa, a Volunteer Helper of the SpaceLiving Discord Server.<br />
Can you open your SpaceLiving App on your computer?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Yes, I'll find it, and also, my dog is named Lisa too xD," replied Littletato, who clicked on the SpaceLiving App icon on the start menu of Windows 10.<br />
"I opened it," said Littletato.<br />
"Your dog is named Lisa too? Hehe, xD.<br />
Okay, now click on the LonelyShip - LS tab at the left, then click on the Manage Things button," explained Lisa in a message.<br />
"Right, I'm now seeing the Add, Edit, and Remove buttons.<br />
I clicked on the Add button and four categories appeared, Furniture, Items, Electronics, and Living," said Littletato.<br />
"Yes, you can add, edit, and remove furniture, items like blankets, clothes, electronics like your computer, screen, mouse, video game consoles.<br />
You can't edit living things though xD, you can adopt a pet on the add button, clicking on it, and selecting the Living option," said Lisa.<br />
"Oh, okay, thanks, hehe," said Littletato.<br />
"No problem, tell me if you need more help ^^," said Lisa.<br />
<br />
Lisa thought about something, she opened the direct message of Ted with her, she saw that he was playing the Call of Duty Warzone game.<br />
"Hey, onii-chan, did mom and dad told you how our sisters were? Or how they looked like," asked Lisa in her message to Ted, her brother.<br />
Ted just finished his match of the FPS game, he pressed Alt and Tab to change windows, then he read Lisa's message on Discord.<br />
"Hmm... I think dad told me about it, he said that one had brown hair and the other one had blond hair," replied Ted.<br />
"Oh, thanks nii-chan, hmm... What if... One of them is here in the network?" asked Lisa.<br />
"What? Do you think one of them is here?" asked Ted, surprised.<br />
"Yeah... I think it is Littletato, from the Discord server, check her profile out," said Lisa.<br />
"Oh, okay..." said Ted, who searched for Littletato on the Discord of the SpaceLiving Network, he checked her profile.<br />
"But... How you gonna make sure that it is her?" asked Ted.<br />
"Well... I'm gonna ask her parents' names.<br />
If they are the same as ours, then it is her, also, I already talked with her.<br />
She asked me for help in adding new things to the LonelyShip," replied Lisa.<br />
"Oh, okay nee-chan, tell me if it is her after her reply," said Ted.<br />
"Okay nii-chan," said Lisa.<br />
Then Lisa opened the direct message of her with Littletato, "Hey... Um... Can I ask you a personal question?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Um... Yes," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, okay, can I know the name of your parents?..." asked Lisa.<br />
"Yes... They're called John and Ana, what's the name of your parents?" asked Littletato.<br />
"They have the same name as your parents... Are you Littletato, one of my sisters that I forgot about?" asked Lisa, surprised.<br />
"Oh... Hmm... I think so, my dad told me about one brother and one sister that I had, the sister had gray hair.<br />
He said that they disappeared at a young age.<br />
Can you send me a picture of you, please?" asked Littletato, a little shocked.<br />
"Hmm... I have gray hair... I think I'm that sister of yours then, do you know the name of your brother?<br />
Here is me," said Lisa.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_salmon border_radius_6_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/SpaceLiving/Lisa.jpg"" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
"I think it started with T, Tad, or something... I can't quite remember.<br />
And also, you look like my sister... Or what I remember of her... Here is me," replied Littletato.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_salmon border_radius_6_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/The Life of Littletato/Littletato.jpg" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
"Oh, okay, it is Ted, and he has brown hair, do you want to meet us?<br />
Like, teleport to my LonelyShip, and then we teleport to Ted's?" asked Lisa.<br />
"And also, I think I remember my sister too, and she was a little like you... With brown hair," said Lisa.<br />
"Yes, that's a great idea, can we go to the house of my parents after that?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes," replied Lisa.<br />
<br />
Then Lisa opened the direct message of her with Ted, it was three AM.<br />
"Hey, nii-chan, Littletato is our sister, she has brown hair, her parents are also called John and Ana.<br />
And she said she had a sister with gray hair, I never mentioned my hair color to her.<br />
I want her to teleport to my LonelyShip, so we can go to yours, is it okay for you?" asked Lisa to Ted.<br />
"Oh, it's okay nee-chan, that's weird... But I'm happy that I'll be able to see my sister again, and apologize to her," replied Ted.<br />
Then Lisa switched to Littletato's direct message, she told her how to send a teleport request to Lisa.<br />
Littletato walked to her LST teleporter, she entered inside it and closed its door, typing the LonelyShip code of Lisa's spaceship on the screen.<br />
After some seconds, Littletato was in Lisa's LonelyShip, "Hey... Sis..." said Lisa, who got up and looked at Littletato.<br />
Lisa walked to Littletato, hugging her, closing her eyes, Littletato hugged Lisa back, closing her eyes, "Hmm... Little sister..." said Littletato.<br />
"Your touch... Your smell... Your voice... I know it, it brings me back memories from my childhood..." said Lisa, feeling Littletato's hug.<br />
"Me too, sis... I'm seeing memories from my childhood, I played with you a lot... you were so cute back then, and is still cute," said Littletato.<br />
"The blurry memories from back then, when there were two people along with my sister and me.<br />
These two other people were blank and blurry, I couldn't remember their faces, voices, or how they looked like.<br />
But now I see that one of them was you, Lisa, my sister, who had gray hair... My mind is filling that blank space with you," explained Littletato.<br />
"Me too... I'm remembering how you were back then, we played a lot together in the dirt," said Lisa.<br />
"What is your age right now, sis?" asked Lisa.<br />
"I have twenty, what's yours?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I have seventeen, where do you live now, sis?" asked Lisa.<br />
"I live in San Francisco, California," replied Littletato.<br />
Then they broke from the hug, Lisa and Littletato looked at each other.<br />
"I'm happy to see you again, sister," said Littletato.<br />
"Me too, sis, I'm sorry if I disappeared suddenly when you and I were little," said Lisa, a little sad.<br />
"Oh, it's okay sis, speaking of that, why did you disappear? What happened?" asked Littletato, curious.<br />
<br />

		This is the sequel of chapter ten of <a class="text_dark_blue" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/New World/SpaceLiving/en/" target="_blank">"SpaceLiving"</a>.<br />
And said chapter is the sequel to chapter twenty-six of The Life of Littletato, the previous one on this website.<br />
Read the previous chapter then chapter ten of <a class="text_dark_blue" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/New World/SpaceLiving/en/" target="_blank">"SpaceLiving"</a> to know what happened during Littletato's trip to the <a class="text_dark_blue" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/New World/SpaceLiving/en/" target="_blank">"SpaceLiving"</a> world.<br />
<br />
It was morning on a Saturday, nine AM.<br />
Julia was worried about Littletato, she was searching for her in the house and outside too.<br />
After her trip to a LonelyShip of the <a class="text_dark_blue" href="https://thestake2.netlify.app/New World/SpaceLiving/en/" target="_blank">"SpaceLiving"</a> Network, Littletato arrived home safely, she was on the bed.<br />
Julia walked to the bedroom and saw Littletato on the bed, she was very worried, she walked close to the bed and sat on it, hugging Littletato tight.<br />
"Oh honey, I was so worried, I woke up and you just disappeared, I didn't know where you were," said Julia, sad.<br />
Littletato explained everything to her, she told her not to be worried, telling her that she was safe right now.<br />
She said that she was teleported to a spaceship called LonelyShip, which exists on the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
"I also found my forgotten brother and sister, Ted and Lisa, the ones I told you about some months after we started dating," said Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that's cool honey, I'm glad you found them, how do they look like?" asked Julia.<br />
Then Littletato grabbed her phone, she opened the Discord app on it.<br />
All of her direct messages that she opened on the LonelyShip were there.<br />
She opened the direct message of hers with Lisa, then she clicked on the photo that Lisa sent her, of Lisa and Ted together.<br />
"So those are your siblings, Lisa and Ted?" asked Julia, looking at the picture.<br />
"Yeah, they are," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, it should have been a unique experience for you, honey," said Julia.<br />
"Yes, it was, I reunited with my forgotten brother and sister, I also met my brother's girlfriend.<br />
And I had breakfast with my forgotten siblings, Carol, and my parents, John and Ana.<br />
I used an automatic fridge that created food that you thought about, called the TPF fridge or a Thought-Powered fridge.<br />
The LonelyShip had an Artificial Intelligence that helped you manage the spaceship and modify its things, the LonelyShip had a powerful computer," explained Littletato to Julia.<br />
"That's wonderful to hear honey, hehe, I'm happy for you, let's make breakfast hon?" asked Julia.<br />
"Okay honey," replied Littletato.<br />
<br />
Julia brew some coffee for Littletato, Littletato made some slices of bread with butter.<br />
Then Julia made a cappuccino for them to drink, the couple had breakfast together, it was delicious.<br />
Julia was happy to have Littletato back, Littletato explained more things about her trip to the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
The couple gave food to Lisa, Littletato was stroking Lisa's fur while she ate the food.<br />
Littletato thought about Lisa, her sister, who lives on the SpaceLiving Network.<br />
She had a good time there, using the computer, reuniting with her brother and her sister.<br />
Eating with her family all together and united.<br />
Littletato wished to make another trip to her LonelyShip, to talk with Lisa.<br />
Julia told Littletato that she wanted to live inside a LonelyShip with her.<br />
Littletato said that they could receive a LovelyShip, which was a type of LonelyShip that was made for couples.<br />
Then Littletato grabbed her phone, she opened the Discord app and sent a message to Lisa, to see if she could contact Lisa even if she was not in her LonelyShip.<br />
The message was sent to Lisa, and she replied.<br />
Littletato was sitting on the couch of the living room, Julia was washing the dishes.<br />
"Hey sis, are you inside your LonelyShip right now?<br />
The breakfast at dad's house was very good, right? I loved seeing the family reunited again," said Lisa.<br />
"No, I teleported back to my LonelyShip after we said bye to dad, mom, and Carol.<br />
Then I laid at my bed, and I began to sleep, I began to float again, and after I woke up, I noticed that I was laying on the bed of my house in San Francisco," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, really? That's weird...<br />
I never heard about a LonelyShipper getting teleported back to its Earth house without wanting to," said Lisa.<br />
"I have a girlfriend, you know, her name is Julia, I think I already showed you a picture of her, right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yes, you did, what about it?" asked Lisa.<br />
"So, she was very worried when I came back to here, she asked where I was, I was sad seeing her like that," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, maybe the LonelyShip knew that someone was worried about you at that time and teleported you back to where you were," said Lisa.<br />
"That's a good theory, the LonelyShip knows a lot about feelings.<br />
So, how you doing right now?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I'm good, I woke up some minutes ago, I already took a bath, drank some water, and ate, I'm just checking the notifications of Wattpad.<br />
After that I'm gonna continue to write chapter twelve of The Oddities of Nature, what about you?" asked Lisa.<br />
"Well, I and Julia just had breakfast, and I don't know what we're gonna do, we're gonna decide xD," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, okay sis, hehe, I'm gonna close Discord to go write a little, tell Julia that I said hi," said Lisa.<br />
"Okay, hehe, I'll tell her, laters sis," said Littletato.<br />
"Laters :D," said Lisa.<br />
<br />
"Hey honey, I was talking with Lisa on Discord, she said hi to you," said Littletato to Julia.<br />
"Oh, tell her I said hi too, hehe," replied Julia from the kitchen, it was ten AM.<br />
"Okay honey, also, I'm gonna take a bath right now okay?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Oh, okay hon, after I finish the dishes, I'm gonna play a little on the Vbox One," replied Julia.<br />
Then Littletato left her phone charging on the wall socket of the bedroom, she prepared her things to take a bath.<br />
The girl walked inside the bathroom and started to take her bath.<br />
Julia finished washing the dishes, she stored them on the kitchen cabinet.<br />
She walked to the living room and turned the Vbox One on, grabbing its controller.<br />
Julia opened the Titanfall 2 game to play, she started playing an online match on it.<br />
After some minutes, Littletato finished her bath, she got out of the bathroom and walked to the bedroom.<br />
Littletato wore some comfortable clothes, walking to the kitchen.<br />
"I'm gonna read some stories on Wattpad okay hon?" asked Littletato to Julia.<br />
"Oh, okay hon, hehe, if you discover a new story, send me the link of it through Vegesapp," replied Julia.<br />
"Okay, hehe," said Littletato, who grabbed her water bottle from the fridge, she walked to the computer room.<br />
Littletato turned the computer on, logged on to her Windows account, and opened Mozilla Firefox.<br />
She opened the Wattpad/Veggepad website, a new story appeared on her home page.<br />
It was called "The Life of Littletato", she found that weird, why she was in a story on the Internet?<br />
The author was called "Stake2", she started reading the first chapter of that story.<br />
It had a picture of a girl with brown hair that looked like her on the story cover.<br />
She read the first chapter and thought about writing a comment to the writer.<br />
"Hey... It looks like I'm in this story, that's weird...<br />
Are you stalking me or something?<br />
I feel observed like there's a lot of cameras in my house right now...<br />
How did you write this and why?" asked Littletato in her comment to Stake2.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Stake2 replied to her comment on the first chapter.<br />
"Hey... I'm your creator Littletato, my name is Izaque.<br />
I created your world in... 05/08/2017 I think.<br />
I created an account here in Wattpad and I created a story just to test the website.<br />
I thought about 'potato' and it became you and your world.<br />
'The Life of Littletato', the story has a website too.<br />
You live in a different universe than mine, I am not the Izaque of the SpaceLiving universe.<br />
I'm the Izaque of the Earth universe, the Normal Earth Izaque.<br />
I loved to create you, Littletato - Pequenata, you're my daughter, and I love you... &lt;3 :3," replied Stake2 in his comment.<br />
<br />
Littletato drank some sips of her water bottle.<br />
She saw the notification on Wattpad telling her that Stake2 replied to her comment.<br />
The girl clicked on the notification and started reading the comment.<br />
"Hey, Izaque... So you're my creator, right?<br />
Now I see you as a father... My reality was created by you... That's weird...<br />
I guess I'm happy because of that, thanks for creating me Izaque.<br />
Thanks for giving life to my life, and creating my universe.<br />
You could have done bad things to me, or written some horror or tragic story.<br />
But you decided to make me happy, to give Julia and Lisa to me.<br />
That experience in the SpaceLiving Network was awesome.<br />
Thank you, Izaque, my creator, father, my daddy, for creating my universe and my reality, I love you so much! &lt;3 :3.<br />
Can I have your Discord please?" asked Littletato in a comment to Izaque.<br />
Littletato felt happy knowing that her universe was created by Izaque, it was eleven AM.<br />
She started reading another story, reading chapter ten of The Life of Bigbeet, by stane2.<br />
After some minutes of reading, Littletato finished reading the chapter, she gave it a vote and commented on it.<br />
Littletato received a notification telling her that Stake2 replied to her comment.<br />
<br />
"Hey, Littletato, yes, I'm your creator.<br />
I love you my daughter, my little blossom :3.<br />
I'll send you my Discord name and discriminator on the Inbox of Wattpad," replied Stake2 in his comment on Littletato's comment.<br />
Then Littletato received an Inbox message from Stake2, it was his Discord name and discriminator.<br />
Littletato added Izaque on Discord, she opened Discord in a new tab of Mozilla Firefox.<br />
"Hey, daddy, I'm so happy that I found my story on Wattpad, the story you created, hehe :3," said Littletato.<br />
"I'm happy that I started writing your story, and that I created your universe.<br />
I always believed that everything that we humans create, exists in another universe.<br />
Every anime, cartoon, series, movie, or story, exists in another universe.<br />
And I'm happy that I can talk with you right now," replied Izaque in a message.<br />
"So... Can I call you Daddy?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Of course, hehe, can I call you baby?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Yes, hehe, hey... Daddy, why do you created me?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I created you to test Wattpad, and I created an account there because I wanted to write too.<br />
I read a Brazilian story that was a science fiction story, it made me feel feelings about it, and I wanted to do that too, to my readers.<br />
I liked to create your story in 2017, it helped me start in writing, and it gave me confidence.<br />
Since I created you, I began to write more and more, to get better at writing, translating, and revising.<br />
And I revised all of the twenty-seven chapters of your story, I even made a crossover with SpaceLiving," replied Izaque in his message.<br />
"Oh, hehe, thanks for telling me that, you're very good at writing daddy, I'm happy that I helped you write and get better at writing.<br />
I'm happy that you made it possible for me to find my brother and my sister, Ted and Lisa, I was so happy at that moment.<br />
When I ate with my family, with John, Ana, Carol, Lisa, Ted, hmm... Thank you, daddy, for writing that," said Littletato, she was very happy, talking with her father.<br />
"No problem baby, hehe, I love to write your story," said Izaque.<br />
<br />
"Hey, can I ask you to give me something, daddy?" asked Littletato, it was mid-day.<br />
"Yes, anything you want, baby," replied Izaque.<br />
"Hmm... I want to live in a mansion with all of my friends, Julia's sister, and my sister," said Littletato.<br />
"Oh, I guess Julia already talked about that, right?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Yes, she did, can you give me a better rank at my job?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, I can, who do you want to live with?" asked Izaque.<br />
"I want to live with Yam, Carol, Vitória, Julia of course, hehe, and I want the mansion to be a trusted house in Lisa's and Ted's LonelyShip.<br />
So they can come to the mansion to eat with us, to do stuff together, play games, hang out," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, okay baby, I'll give you that, it would be awesome to write that, hehe, what about Mia?" asked Izaque.<br />
"I think I don't know her very well to call her to live with me," replied Littletato.<br />
"Okay baby, I'll write the progression to that on the next chapters of The Life of Littletato, after chapter twenty-seven.<br />
Anyway, I'm revising a chapter of your story here, and I'm almost finishing it, it has one hundred forty-four lines.<br />
Today is also a Saturday for me, hehe, what a coincidence.<br />
I'm gonna leave to have some lunch in a few minutes, so, laters baby, I love you :3," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, okay daddy, thanks for writing the journey to the mansion, hehe.<br />
Good lunch, I love you too, daddy, laters :3," replied Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato closed the Discord tab of the Mozilla Firefox.<br />
She drank more of her water bottle, which had 2 liters, then she walked to the kitchen and stored the water bottle on the fridge.<br />
Littletato walked to the computer room again, she turned her computer off.<br />
Then she walked to the living room, she sat beside Julia, who was playing Don't Starve Hamlet on the Vbox One.<br />
"Hey, honey, let's make lunch? I'm a little hungry," asked Littletato.<br />
"Oh, yeah, hehe," said Julia, looking at Littletato, giving a kiss on her lips.<br />
Julia paused the game and save it, she opened the games menu of the Vbox One and closed the game.<br />
Then she held the Vbox Live button on the controller, turning the video game off.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Julia got up, they walked to the kitchen.<br />
Julia grabbed the rice from the kitchen cabinet.<br />
She put a pan with vegetable oil on the oven to heat.<br />
Julia added the salt, rice, and water, simmering it for two minutes.<br />
She left it heating without a lid, letting it boil.<br />
When the water started to boil, Julia lowered the fire.<br />
Littletato grabbed some artificial vegetables from the drawer of the fridge.<br />
She began to cut them, making an artificial salad.<br />
Julia had to leave the rice in the oven for twenty minutes for the water to evaporate.<br />
After making the salad, Littletato got some artificial meat from the fridge.<br />
Littletato cut and seasoned the artificial meat with salt, pepper, and garlic, making some beef slices.<br />
Then she put some oil in a frying pan, putting it in the oven for the oil to heat.<br />
She began frying the two artificial beef slices, it looked delicious.<br />
After some minutes, everything was ready, the rice, the artificial salad, and the fried artificial beef.<br />
Littletato and Julia began to eat lunch together, it was really delicious.<br />
Julia said that Littletato did a good job on the artificial beef.<br />
Littletato told Julia about what happened, about Izaque being the creator of them.<br />
Julia found that weird and was a little shocked, but she understood it.<br />
She wanted to talk with Izaque after lunch, to know more about that.<br />
<br />
(I loved revising this chapter.<br />
I wrote it on 03/05/2021.<br />
And finished revising it on 12/06/2021, a Saturday.<br />
I spent so much time translating the revised chapters of The Life of Littletato and SpaceLiving.<br />
That I forgot how to write in English and how to revise xD.<br />
But it was very good to revise this chapter, I revised it while listening to the Yuru Camp soundtrack.<br />
I love to write stories while listening to that soundtrack, it makes me calm.<br />
And makes me think about all of the past times that I spent writing stories while listening to that soundtrack.<br />
Today is Saturday, I've been trying to sleep early recently, and I think I'm being pretty successful at that.<br />
I've been getting up early, and having more happiness, having more disposition to do things.<br />
Anyway, right now in Brazil is mid-day, I have gotta eat lunch.<br />
Thank you for reading this chapter, thank you, hehe.<br />
Goodbye, or should I say, laters :D.)

(The beautiful Life of Littletato, with much love, Izaque.)<br />
Littletato was dreaming about being a unicorn in the land of Equestria.<br />
She was a purple pony who likes to read books, study things and make science.<br />
That unicorn has five friends, one yellow, another blue, the other one was pink, another one was white, the last one was orange.<br />
She loved all of her friends, and she liked to be with them, they always helped her when she needed it the most.<br />
One of her friends was called Fluttershy, she had a yellow coat and a light pink mane.<br />
Another one was called Rainbow Dash, she had a blue coat and a rainbow mane.<br />
There was another one that had pink skin, she was called Pinkie Pie and had a darker pink mane.<br />
Another one had a white coat and a purple mane, she was called Rarity.<br />
The last friend was called Applejack, she had an orange coat and a yellow mane.<br />
That unicorn that Littletato was knew how to do spells with her horn.<br />
She had a friend called Spike, who was her dragon helper, he could send messages to the princess and ruler of Equestria, her name is Celestia.<br />
Twilight Sparkle was the name of the unicorn that Littletato was in that dream.<br />
She was in her Crystal Castle or Castle of Friendship, she was an alicorn at that point, a mixture of a unicorn and a pegasus.<br />
A unicorn is a pony that has magic inside of them and can make spells with its horn.<br />
A pegasus is a pony who also has magic inside of them and can use that magic to fly with wings.<br />
Twilight Sparkle had both wings and a horn.<br />
She was in her Crystal Castle, reading a book called "The story of the land of Equestria".<br />
It was about a cartoon about six ponies who were super friends and liked to have fun together, and about some humans on planet Earth who liked to watch that cartoon.<br />
Because that book was the book version of the cartoon that existed on Earth.<br />
It talked about anons or anonymous and humans that watched the show.<br />
One human was called Izaque, he was using his computer to write a story about one potato on the Internet.<br />
That chapter was about a specific cartoon being a dream of the main character of the story.<br />
The name of the story was "tatoLittle", Izaque was so happy writing that, a story that he loves a lot, and a cartoon that he loves a lot (My Little Pony).<br />
Littletato in the body of Twilight Sparkle was reading the story, she thought it was a pretty good one.<br />
She liked the character of Izaque because it reminded her of her creator and father, Izaque.<br />
<br />
Littletato thinks he is having fun there, creating her story, having fun while writing, she is so thankful to him, because he created her and her universe.<br />
He gave life to Littletato, and she loves Izaque, she is so happy because of him, and he is so happy because of her.<br />
Then, Littletato, while being Twilight Sparkle, notices that a portal has opened inside her Crystal Castle, an old friend of her from Earth, Izaque, was inside it.<br />
He had beautiful yellow wings of fire and a yellow hand-grappling hook made of lava fluid.<br />
Izaque steps out of the purple portal and talks with her.<br />
"Hey Twilight, how are you?" he asks.<br />
"I'm good, what about you, Izaque?" she asks.<br />
"Me too, long time no see right?" asks him.<br />
Then Twilight replies, "Yeah, but you're here now, and I'm happy because of that".<br />
He said that he was talking with a friend of his, a friend from a distant place.<br />
Izaque was sat on the blue comfy carpet that Twilight had.<br />
She stopped reading her book to listen to him and looked at him.<br />
"Her name is Littletato... I'm her creator, her father, you know...<br />
I wrote this story in 2017, it was called Littletato too, it was so awesome.<br />
I felt so happy writing it, I felt so incredible, it is still awesome to write that story," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, that's very great to hear Izaque! I'm glad you're having so much fun writing it.<br />
Two thousand and seventeen was a long time ago on Earth, right?<br />
You're inspiring me to write a story Izaque! Hehe, that makes me so happy.<br />
I got inspired seeing that you still write your story to this day and are so dedicated to it," said Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Yeah, it was a very long time ago.<br />
Well... Today right now on Earth it's the year 2019, so it was very long ago.<br />
I'm glad I inspired you to write something Twilight, hehe.<br />
If you need help just tell me okay? I'll be happy to help you write something," said Izaque.<br />
"I would love that, hehe, please teach me, Izaque-sensei (teacher Izaque in English).<br />
So... How did you speak with her? Was it good?" asked Twilight Sparkle.<br />
"Yeah, it was pretty good.<br />
Well... I think she saw the Littletato story on Wattpad and sent a comment saying that she was in that story.<br />
Then we talked a little through comments on the comment section of the first chapter of my story.<br />
After that, she asked for my Discord name and discriminator, I sent an Inbox message to her with my data.<br />
She added me and we started talking, she thanked me for everything that I did for her.<br />
Even if what I did was just create a story and make good things happen to her.<br />
I'm thankful for meeting her, and I'm happy that I created her story, she is my daughter.<br />
She calls me daddy, and I'm happy because of that..." explained Izaque.<br />
"Oh, that's a pretty good way of meeting someone, meeting them because you wrote a story about them," said Twilight, giggling a little.<br />
"I don't know what Discord is, is it a network that Discord created or something?<br />
How can you two connect that way?<br />
Sometimes I can't understand Discord..." said Twilight.<br />
"Well, Twilight, it isn't the Discord of Equestria, you know.<br />
Discord is only the name of a social network that exists on Earth.<br />
A technology network exists on a website where people can talk with each other and exchange messages.<br />
I also can't understand him, but he's cool and funny, I wanted to be weird and random like him," replied Izaque.<br />
<br />
Littletato in the body of Twilight Sparkle was happy because she was talking with Izaque personally.<br />
Even if she was a pony in Equestria, she loved that moment, she wished that Julia was there with her.<br />
Suddenly, she was Asuna from Japanese animation or anime called Sword Art Online.<br />
She was fighting by the side of Kirito, which reminded her of Izaque, so courageous.<br />
Silica was there too, a friend of Kirito, Silica reminded Littletato of Julia, so cute and innocent.<br />
Then she was in the Yuru Camp anime, she was Shimarin or Rin Shima, a camping girl with dark blue hair.<br />
She was sat beside Nadeshiko, a friend of hers, who had pink hair, which reminded her of Julia, cute and innocent too.<br />
There was also Ena Saitou there, another girl with dark purple hair, which reminded her of Izaque somehow.<br />
She was so happy being there, camping with those girls, it felt calm and relaxing, camping was very fun.<br />
After some seconds, she was in the body of Izaque, it felt weird being him.<br />
He was writing a story called "The Life of Littletato", he was so happy writing that story.<br />
Izaque was also talking with some friends of him on Discord.<br />
He liked to have company while writing, but not focus too much on it.<br />
Littletato thought that it was incredible, feeling all of his feelings, she loved to be in his place.<br />
She wished that she was there with him, sitting beside him, hugging him, and calling him her daddy.<br />
Talking, doing things together, hanging out.<br />
She thought that she was loving him, but no, she only wanted to be his friend and saw him as her father.<br />
Because he is so incredible to her, being so good and gentle, giving Julia to her, he is everything for her, she loved Julia and Izaque very much.<br />
Littletato is still dreaming, thinking, imaging, she loves her life.<br />
She loves to be where she is right now, with her friends, Izaque, thinking about all of the things she can do.<br />
Everything that she could do right now, she wants, she wants to live her life so much right now.<br />
With all of her dreams reminding her about what she haves, and something that someone gave to her, which was life, by Izaque.<br />
<br />
Just like me, being happy for having the ability to write stories, to create things, to create art.<br />
To be able to draw pixel art, drawings in Paint Tool SAI, to be able to show my stories to a specific friend of mine.<br />
She makes me more proud of the stories of mine that I am right now, I love to make stories, and she makes that feeling bigger.<br />
That ergonomic gamer chair that I could draw in that pixel art made me so happy, hehe, it was so beautiful.<br />
Littletato is going to have a good night of sleep right now, and good dreams.<br />
Good night for you too, there, reading this story right now, I do not know who you are, but I probably love you, thank you for reading this!<br />
I love you so much, my reader, and if you are a friend of mine on Discord, screenshot this part and send it to me!<br />
This chapter felt like an ending for "The Life of Littletato", what do you think? Should it end in this chapter?<br />
I think we had a long journey, from 2017 to here, four years writing "The Life of Littletato".<br />
Writing, revising, translating, programming the website in PHP, making book covers.<br />
Writing and perfecting the story, making it better.<br />
Gaining readers, losing readers, discovering a recent friend that likes to read stories and liked a lot to read Littletato.<br />
To know that it already has been four years since I write Littletato and that I got a lot better along this journey.<br />
This gives me the strength to continue... Gives me the strength to write more stories, more chapters.<br />
Strength to face and overcome the fear of not being able to create chapter 30 of "The Life of Littletato".<br />
Or not being able to create more chapters of "SpaceLiving".<br />
I can always write and revise, I just need to start and try, I do not need to have fear of not making it.<br />
I already created twenty-nine chapters of Littletato, why I would not be able to create one more?<br />
Tell me if you think "The Life of Littletato" should end here in this chapter.<br />
Thank you for reading, I'm Izaque, living in 2021 while I write this, good night, good dreams, love you, peace! ❤️.<br />
The beautiful Life of Littletato, Episode 28, with much love, Izaque ❤️.)

		It was a Sunday in the year 2020, Littletato woke up at six AM, she did her morning necessities.<br />
Then Julia woke up, she also did her morning necessities.<br />
Both of them walked to the kitchen, they started to prepare breakfast together.<br />
Julia and Littletato finished preparing breakfast, they started to eat.<br />
"Hey, honey, I think I have enough money on the bank to buy a house or a mansion, for us to live with our friends," said Julia to Littletato.<br />
"Oh, really? How much you have honey?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I have two million one hundred thousand stored in my bank account, I've had some investments while also working, hehe," said Julia, smiling at Littletato.<br />
"That's really great hon! Hehe, with your money and my one million one hundred forty thousand we can buy a mansion and also pay the bills for some months!" said Littletato, happy and excited.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, so let's look for a mansion in San Francisco for us to buy after breakfast?" asked Julia.<br />
"Yes, hehe," replied Littletato.<br />
Then the couple finished eating breakfast, it was very delicious.<br />
After that, Julia and Littletato washed the dishes together, they walked to the computer room.<br />
Littletato sat on the chair of her computer, she turned it on.<br />
She also grabbed her phone which was charging on the wall socket close to the computer.<br />
Julia grabbed her phone from the bedroom, which was charging too, it was fully charged.<br />
She sat on the chair of her computer, turning the phone on.<br />
"So, honey, with your money and mine together, we have three million two hundred forty thousand, right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, that's right hon," said Julia.<br />
Then Littletato began searching for mansions in San Francisco, CA, she found some at the price of one million, and some pricier.<br />
"Hey hon, what do you think about this one that costs one million two hundred thousand?" asked Littletato.<br />
Julia looked at the computer screen, she saw that the house had six thousand square feet, it had nine bedrooms and seven bathrooms, also four parking spaces.<br />
"It's very good honey, it has enough bedrooms to accommodate all of our friends," replied Julia.<br />
"Yes, hehe, I want to live with Carol, Vitória, Yam, and also Lisa and Ted," said Littletato.<br />
"Lisa and Ted are going to live with us? I think they have their spaceships to live on, right?" asked Julia.<br />
"Yeah, but I'm gonna ask them to add the mansion as a trusted house on their LonelyShip.<br />
So they can come to our mansion when they wanted, to make parties and stuff, what do you think, hon?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think that's a good idea hon, I would be happy to meet your other two brothers, and also Carol, I only talked with her on Vegesapp," replied Julia.<br />
"Oh, okay hon, hehe, can you send the money to my bank account?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay hon," replied Julia, who opened her bank app and transferred the money to Littletato's bank account.<br />
<br />
After that, Littletato created an account on the website where she saw the ad of the mansion of one million two hundred thousand dollars.<br />
She called the seller that was going to sell her the house, they talked for a while, Littletato asked questions about the house, to know if it had any problems.<br />
He said that everything was working properly.<br />
Littletato made the offer of one million two hundred thousand dollars to the seller.<br />
She asked her bank for a proof-of-funds document, proving that she had the money to buy the house.<br />
Littletato included an inspection and appraisal contingency to the offer.<br />
To indicate that she would like to buy the house as long as the home inspection reveals that the house is in good working order.<br />
And the appraisal comes back in the ballpark of the purchase price, the seller accepted Littletato's offer to the house.<br />
Littletato scheduled a home inspection to the house, she and Julia drove to the house by car.<br />
They arrived there and checked everything in the house, they checked if everything was working right.<br />
After that, they got home again, Littletato made some title research on the house, to make sure there are no unknown liens or claims on the house before she takes ownership.<br />
The house had a clearly defined lot that showed the property boundaries of the house.<br />
She also bought homeowner's insurance, to make sure that her money is insured in case something unexpected happens.<br />
Littletato also asked for an appraisal of the house, to make sure that the house was worth what she was paying for.<br />
The girl planned a wire transfer between her and the owner of the house to transfer her money to the owner.<br />
She paid the association fees, closing costs, and got to the closing table, she signed the paperwork to transfer the house to her name.<br />
Then she transferred the money to the bank account of the old owner of the house.<br />
The owner gave the house keys to Littletato, she and Julia were there at the house, they were so happy.<br />
<br /><img class="image_size border_4px border_color_light_salmon border_radius_6_cent box_shadow_black" src="https://thestake2.netlify.app/Images/Images/The Life of Littletato/Mansion of Littletato and Friends.png" style="max-width: 50%;" /><br /><br />
Littletato and Julia looked at the house, it was so beautiful, so big, they entered the house.<br />
"Hey honey, we gonna be left with one million forty thousand dollars of money left.<br />
And I calculated that we gonna pay seven thousand six hundred eighty of annual property taxes," explained Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that's okay hon, we have the money to pay that annually, right?" asked Julia.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," replied Littletato.<br />
<br />
Then Littletato sent a text message to Carol, asking if she wanted to live with her, she said yes, it was seven AM.<br />
After that, Julia sent a text message to Vitória, asking if she wanted to live with her and Littletato, Vitória said yes.<br />
Littletato and Julia asked all of their friends if they wanted to live with them, they replied positively.<br />
Then Littletato made a Partnership Agreement.<br />
It is a legal contract entered into when a group of individuals goes in together in a joint venture.<br />
The partnership agreement will dictate how Littletato and her friends will be required to interact when it comes to purchasing and living in the home.<br />
While she and her friends can agree to almost anything, if she fails to address certain issues, state laws (usually called Uniform Partnership Acts) will fill in the blanks for her.<br />
Littletato and her friends will take the title as tenants in common.<br />
As tenants in common, every partner will have an equal right to possess and use the whole property while maintaining the ability to transfer their interest to anyone they want.<br />
She called everyone to the house, Yam, Carol, Vitória, Lisa, Ted, and Monika, they signed the Partnership Agreement.<br />
Littletato told to Yam who everyone was, her sisters, brother, the sister of Julia, and Monika.<br />
Lisa and Ted added the house as a trusted house to their LonelyShips.<br />
Ted and Lisa hugged Julia and Vitória, they liked to meet them.<br />
Littletato and the others discussed who would do maintenance, repairs, how the property would be used, who would be allowed besides the owners.<br />
She also discussed with them the house rules and other things.<br />
"I'm so happy right now, owning a house with you guys," said Julia, smiling while looking at them.<br />
"Me too, hehe, it looks fun," said Lisa.<br />
"So, Carol will mow the lawn, Vitória will take out the trash, Yam will fix broken windows and other broken things of the house.<br />
I and Julia will take care of paying the bills, fees, and the annual tax, we just need you guys to give a part of your money for us to pay the bills, okay?" asked Littletato.<br />
Then everyone replied positively, "Hey, we have enough space for our cars right?" asked Yam.<br />
"Yes, we have four garage spaces here, one for me and Julia, one for Carol, Vitória, and you Yam, if we need more space there's always the yard," replied Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato decided what bedroom would be for who.<br />
"So, you guys can move when you're ready, we gonna move today, Vitória can do her job remotely right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah," replied Vitória.<br />
"You too, right sis?" asked Littletato to Carol.<br />
"Yes, hehe," replied Carol.<br />
Then everyone got out of the house, they got their cars to go to their houses to bring their stuff.<br />
Lisa, Ted, and Monika teleported to their LonelyShips, they created some things with the Thing Creator, using the SpaceLiving App.<br />
They made a copy of their powerful computers to bring them to their bedrooms in Littletato's mansion.<br />
Lisa and Ted also asked for a TPF Transformation Device, which was a device that could transform a normal fridge into a TPF fridge.<br />
They both got one and teleported back to Littletato's mansion.<br />
The LonelyShip Teleporter or LST of Lisa was in Lisa's bedroom on the mansion, Ted's and Monika's LSTs were also in their bedroom.<br />
Lisa, Ted, and Monika placed the copies of their computers in their bedrooms.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Julia drove back home, they hired a local company to move their stuff to the mansion.<br />
After some minutes, they arrived there with a small truck, they started packing the things inside the house, it was eight AM.<br />
Littletato told them to pack the computers, electronic stuff, the video game and television, and the dishware.<br />
Julia filled up some boxes and bags with their clothes, the movers grabbed the boxes and bags and placed them on the moving truck.<br />
Littletato told the address of the mansion to the movers, they started driving there.<br />
Julia and Littletato finished getting the other things of the house, they left the built-in furniture, the bed, the couch, and other things.<br />
They placed everything on the front trunk of the car, they also got Lisa's stuff, Julia would take Lisa, the dog, in her trunk.<br />
Littletato locked the house and entered the car, Julia was already there on the passenger's seat, holding Lisa.<br />
After that, Littletato began driving to the mansion while listening to a rock song on the car's radio, using her phone on Bluetooth mode.<br />
They were so happy about owning a mansion with their friends.<br />
Julia was smiling, looking at the road, thinking about the mansion.<br />
After some minutes of driving, Littletato arrived there with the car, she parked it on the road.<br />
Then she got out of the car, Julia did that too, Littletato locked the car.<br />
Littletato told the movers where to put the boxes and the bags, they placed them in the bedroom of Littletato and Julia in the mansion.<br />
After that, Littletato paid the movers when they finished their job, it was $150 in total.<br />
Then Littletato opened the front trunk of her car, Julia left Lisa in the closed yard of the mansion, where there was a pool.<br />
Julia and Littletato began bringing the boxes and bags that they placed on the car's trunk.<br />
They placed the boxes and bags in their bedroom of the mansion.<br />
Lisa and Ted walked to the big kitchen of the mansion, they looked at each other and the device in their hands.<br />
"Oh, you also thought in transforming the fridge into a TPF fridge, hehe," said Ted, smiling.<br />
"Yeah, I think it would be great, hehe, to eat any food when you want," said Lisa.<br />
Then they both placed the devices on the sides of the two-door fridge, the devices looked like they were electrocuting the fridge.<br />
After some seconds, the devices disappeared and made a booming sound, Lisa opened the fridge thinking about a slice of pizza.<br />
There was a slice of pizza inside the fridge, Lisa looked at Ted and smiled, Ted smiled back.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Julia walked to the kitchen, it was nine AM.<br />
"Oh, you guys are here, did you two finished bringing the stuff of your LonelyShips to here?" asked Littletato to Ted and Lisa.<br />
"Yeah, we finished, we just made a copy of our computers and brought them to our bedrooms," explained Lisa.<br />
"And also, test your new fridge, sis," said Ted.<br />
"What? But this fridge isn't new..." said Littletato, who walked to the fridge.<br />
"Open it while thinking of some food," said Lisa.<br />
"This can't be what I think it is..." said Littletato.<br />
Then Littletato opened the fridge while thinking of a chocolate cake.<br />
There was a chocolate cake on the fridge, Littletato smiled.<br />
"Oh, this is a TPF fridge, how did you do that?" asked Littletato, smiling.<br />
"We can ask for a device that transforms any fridge into a TPF fridge," said Ted.<br />
"Yeah, we asked for it on the SpaceLiving App on Windows 10," explained Lisa.<br />
"Oh, thank you, hehe," said Littletato, smiling while hugging Lisa and Ted.<br />
Then Littletato and Julia said bye to Ted and Lisa, they walked to their bedroom to unpack stuff.<br />
They started unpacking the bags and clothes.<br />
Lisa and Ted got back to their bedrooms, they turned their computers on.<br />
Monika was also using her computer, the bedroom of Ted and Monika had space for placing two computers.<br />
Lisa told SpaceLiving Izaque that Littletato had brought a mansion to live in with her friends.<br />
Izaque was very happy knowing that, Lisa also told John about that, he said that it was very cool.<br />
Monika told Sayori, her sister, that she started living in the mansion that her sister-in-law had bought.<br />
Sayori said that she wanted to go to San Francisco to visit her sister, Monika.<br />
Monika asked Littletato if Sayori could go there for a visit, she asked that through Vegesapp/Whatsapp, Littletato said yes.<br />
Littletato and Julia finished unpacking the things and organizing their clothes on the bedroom cabinets.<br />
Julia said that she was a little tired, it was nine and thirty AM, Julia said that she was going to sleep a little, Littletato said okay.<br />
The bedroom of Littletato and Julia had two keys, one stayed at the door and the other one on a keychain on the wall.<br />
<br />
Littletato pocketed one and got out, locking the door so no one disturbed Julia while she slept.<br />
Then Littletato walked to the living room, she left her phone charging there on the wall socket, it was ten AM.<br />
She walked to the kitchen, she was a little hungry.<br />
The girl opened the fridge, she grabbed the sandwich on a plate and the cup of chocolate milk.<br />
After that, she sat at the big dining table, she started to eat, it was very delicious.<br />
Lisa appeared there, she sat on the other side of the table, looking at Littletato.<br />
"When are Vitória, Carol, and Yam coming?" asked Lisa, drinking some sips of her water bottle.<br />
"Vitória said that she's going to take a flight back to New York to bring her stuff.<br />
Carol got her car and started driving back to Los Angeles to bring her stuff too, it was one and a half hours ago.<br />
Yam said that he had to buy some things before packing his stuff, I think he's gonna come soon," replied Littletato.<br />
"Oh, I wanted to talk more to Vitória, I think she is cool," said Lisa, looking at Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, she is very cool, me, Julia, her, and Yam made a barbecue together on a Sunday, just like this one," said Littletato, looking up at the ceiling, thinking of that day.<br />
"It looks like it was very fun, hehe, I wanted to do a barbecue with you, sis," said Lisa, smiling while looking at Littletato.<br />
"Oh, let's make one with everyone then, what do you think, sis?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think it's a great idea, hehe, I'm gonna go sleep a little, I'm a little tired.<br />
I had fun organizing my stuff, hehe, building my computer, and bringing some clothes," said Lisa, getting up.<br />
"Good lunch, sis," said Lisa, who kissed Littletato's cheek and hugged her.<br />
"Oh, thank you, sis, rest well, I love you," said Littletato, hugging Lisa back and kissing her cheek, smiling.<br />
"Thanks, and I love you too, hehe," said Lisa, smiling, who started walking back to her bedroom, she locked her door and laid on the bed, starting to sleep.<br />
Vitória booked her flight from New York to San Francisco, she prepared her bags to bring on the plane.<br />
Yam finished buying the things he needed to pack his stuff, he got back home and started packing his belongings.<br />
After some minutes, he finished packing them, placed everything in his car, and began driving back to Littletato's Mansion.<br />
Littletato had finished eating her sandwich, she still had half of her chocolate milk left to drink.<br />
She got up and walked to the living room, grabbing her phone, then she got back to the kitchen and sat on the chair.<br />
The girl created a group on Vegesapp/Whatsapp and added every resident of the mansion there.<br />
Julia, Vitória, Carol, Lisa, Ted, Monika, and Yam.<br />
Littletato had created another group called The Rules of the Mansion, where only moderators could post, she made Julia a moderator.<br />
She posted the rules of the house there, which bedroom was for who, who did the housework, and other rules.<br />
The other group that she created was called The Mansion of Littletato and Friends.<br />
After everyone was there, Littletato had to take a picture of everyone in the front of the mansion to set it as a picture of the group.<br />
Yam sent a message to the group, "Hey, I liked this group, hehe, thanks for making it Littletato.<br />
I'm gonna check the other group if I forget a rule.<br />
I'm getting there in a minute," said Yam on the message.<br />
<br />
Then, after some minutes of driving, he arrived there and parked his car in the parking space.<br />
He locked his car and unlocked the trunk of it, grabbing his stuff and bringing them to his room.<br />
After that, he locked the trunk of his car and got back to his room, he started organizing his room and his belongings.<br />
Littletato sent a message to the chat group of the mansion.<br />
"Since we have the TPF fridge now, which generates food for us, we don't need to set someone to make food on each day," said Littletato in her message.<br />
"Oh, that's good, now we can eat any food any time, hehe," said Carol in the message.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, when are you gonna arrive here, sis?" asked Littletato.<br />
"In thirty minutes I guess, I'm half of the way to San Francisco," said Carol on the group.<br />
Littletato copied her message talking about the food and the TPF fridge to the rules group, as a notice.<br />
Then she finished drinking her chocolate milk.<br />
She deleted her message talking about the food and the TPF fridge on the rules group.<br />
Littletato made an Announcements group to post the announcements of the mansion, she liked to be organized, only moderators could post there.<br />
She sent the message talking about the food and the TPF fridge there.<br />
The girl also sent a message talking about the Xbox One in the living room.<br />
She said that anyone can play on it, as long as they do not play on the Xbox Live account of another person.<br />
Littletato told them to add their Xbox Live accounts to the Xbox One when they arrive there.<br />
"The kitchen also has a dishwasher, so no one needs to wash dishes, the TPF fridge can also delete dishware, so it's better to use it.<br />
Also, I'll ask everyone to download the lock app, it is an app used to lock and unlock the door of the house.<br />
It was created by a company that creates digital locks for house automation.<br />
Please download the app and send me your IDs in private so I can permit your phones to unlock the house door," said Littletato in a message to the Announcements group.<br />
The girl blocked the screen of her phone and pocketed it, she left her cup on the TPF fridge for it to delete.<br />
After that, she walked to her bedroom, unlocking the door, entering inside it, and locking the door again.<br />
She left her phone charging on the wall socket, besides Julia's phone, she laid beside Julia to sleep with her.<br />
<br />
Lisa, Ted, and Monika were also sleeping, they were tired of organizing their clothes and building their computers.<br />
Vitória was on her flight back to San Francisco.<br />
Carol was arriving in San Francisco, she was heading to Littletato's Mansion.<br />
Yam had finished organizing his stuff, he locked the door and laid on his bed.<br />
"Hey, I'm gonna sleep a little, I'm really tired..." said Yam in a message on the chat group.<br />
Carol had arrived at the mansion, she parked her car there, opening the trunk and bringing her stuff to her bedroom.<br />
Vitória arrived in San Francisco, she got a taxi to go to Littletato's Mansion.<br />
She paid for the taxi and got out of it with her luggage, walking inside the house and going to her bedroom.<br />
Carol got out of the house and locked her car, she got inside again and walked to her bedroom, then she started organizing her stuff.<br />
Vitória also started organizing her stuff.<br />
Littletato and Julia were so happy to be able to live with their friends together in a mansion.<br />
It was a dream that Julia had since chapter fifteen, I mean, since January of 2019.<br />
And this is a big change in the life of Littletato, Julia, and all of the other residents of Littletato's Mansion.<br />
Let's see what this new journey will bring.<br />
<br />
(I loved so much to revise this chapter, I didn't revise it, I deleted everything that existed on it, and created a new thing.<br />
I wrote this chapter on 14/02/2020.<br />
This was when I started watching Dr. Stone: Stone Wars: 14/01/2021.<br />
And I finished revising it on 15/06/2021.<br />
<br />
I loved to write this chapter, to write about Littletato's dream of living with her friends coming true.<br />
It was tough to research and search about how to buy a house with cash in the United States.<br />
I spent a lot of time searching for guides and reading guides on the Internet.<br />
It was so awesome to write about Littletato and her friends moving to the new house, the mansion.<br />
Planning the Partnership Agreement, Lisa, Ted, and Monika adding the mansion as a trusted house to their LonelyShips.<br />
Writing about Littletato eating in the big kitchen and Lisa showing up to talk with her.<br />
Lisa and Ted transforming the fridge into a TPF fridge.<br />
Littletato creating three groups about the mansion, the house, was something that I would do if I would live with friends.<br />
Writing about Littletato hiring the movers was cool too, and getting out of the house, Julia bringing Lisa with her in the car.<br />
Thinking about how the rooms of them look like.<br />
The bedrooms of Ted and Lisa with their LSTs there.<br />
Sayori asking if she could visit Monika in the mansion.<br />
Everyone sleeping because they are tired after they organized their stuff xD.<br />
It was so much fun to write this chapter, I love it, hehe.<br />
I wrote it while listening to the soundtrack of Yuru Camp as always.<br />
Right now is mid-day of 15/06/2021, a Tuesday.<br />
I think I already spent four hours in total on this chapter, writing it, and I loved it.<br />
Thank you so much for reading, hehe ^^.)

		It was a Monday, the first day of January of 2021, it was New Year's Day, Littletato had a great year, and she was ready to start another one.<br />
Littletato was in her bedroom in her mansion, she woke up at eight AM, brushed her teeth, combed her hair, and also washed her face in the bathroom inside her bedroom.<br />
She did not have to work today, today was a federal holiday, she also could take two days off each year.<br />
Littletato thought about everything that she did in 2020.<br />
The girl reunited with her forgotten brother and sister, she also discovered that she is inside a story and that her creator is called Izaque (*wink*).<br />
Littletato dreamed about being the character Twilight Sparkle from the cartoon My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic.<br />
She also had bought a mansion to live in with her friends and invited everyone.<br />
Everyone moved their things to the house and started living there, Carol and Vitória had started working remotely just like they did before, using their computers.<br />
Littletato had put her house for rent, for people to live there, a buyer showed up, he started living on the house, paying the rent and bills.<br />
The girl was downtown with her friends on New Year's Eve, she was with Julia, Carol, Vitória, Ted, Monika, Lisa, and Yam.<br />
Everyone looked at the big screen with the countdown for the new year, Littletato and Julia counted down along with the countdown, just like New Year's Eve in 2018.<br />
Littletato and Julia were happy, spending their New Year's Eve with their friends, they also counted along with Littletato and Julia.<br />
The girl was sitting on the bed, Julia woke up, she did her morning necessities, she and Littletato walked to the kitchen.<br />
Littletato thought about a sandwich with artificial ham and cheese, and also a cup of chocolate milk, she sat at the table.<br />
Julia thought about a hamburger with some artificial salad and some spices, ketchup, and mayonnaise, and also thought about a can of Coca-cola.<br />
She opened the fridge and grabbed the plate with the hamburger and the can of Coca-cola, placing both on the opposite side of where Littletato was sat.<br />
Julia also grabbed the plate with the sandwich with ham and cheese and the cup of chocolate milk which she assumed being of Littletato.<br />
Littletato and Julia started eating breakfast, it was very delicious, it was good eating together.<br />
Carol appeared there, she opened the fridge and grabbed her water bottle, it had two liters of capacity and had half of water.<br />
"Oh, hey, good morning guys," said Carol to Littletato and Julia.<br />
"Good morning," said Julia and Littletato in unison.<br />
"You guys don't work today right?" asked Carol, who sat at the table, drinking some sips of her water bottle.<br />
"Yeah, it's New Year's Day, we also don't work on the day fifteen of January, the birth of Martin Luther King," said Littletato.<br />
"Oh, that's good, hehe, I also don't work today, so, I'm gonna play some games on my computer.<br />
And maybe hang out with my friends around the city," said Carol, smiling.<br />
"That seems interesting, hehe, we're gonna do a walk in the park," said Julia.<br />
"That's interesting too, hehe, I'm gonna go back to my bedroom, see you later, guys," said Carol, smiling, getting up.<br />
"See you later sis," said Littletato.<br />
"See you later, Carol," said Julia.<br />
Then Carol walked back to her bedroom, she brought her water bottle with her, leaving it on the right side of her chair.<br />
<br />
Littletato and Julia finished eating breakfast, they left the plates, cup, and can inside the TPF fridge.<br />
They both walked to their bedroom, entering inside it and grabbing their phones, which were recharging on the wall sockets.<br />
Julia and Littletato used an app to register when they ate, so they can know when they could drink water and when they would be hungry.<br />
After that, Littletato walked to the kitchen, she opened the fridge while thinking about dog food, a bag of dog food was there.<br />
Littletato grabbed it and walked to the closed yard, opening the glass door, the automatic dog feeder was empty, but there was some dog food on the bottom of it.<br />
She filled the dog feeder with the dog food, and also refilled the water bowl with water.<br />
Lisa, the dog of Littletato, was there, she jumped on Littletato's knees, Littletato caressed her head.<br />
The sun was hitting the grass, covering all of the yard space, it was beautiful and warm, Littletato closed the glass door and sat on an outdoor chair.<br />
Julia was inside her bedroom, she grabbed her phone and walked to the closed yard.<br />
She opened the glass door and got outside, closing it, "Hey honey," said her, walking to another outdoor chair and sitting on it.<br />
"Hey, let's go to the park after thirty minutes? When we can drink water or do exercises," asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay honey," replied Julia, she put some calm music to play on her phone.<br />
They both stayed there, in peace, listening to the calm music, looking at nature, feeling the warm sun, seeing the trees wave.<br />
Lisa, the dog, was there, she jumped on Julia's knees, Julia caressed her fur, then Lisa walked to the automatic dog feeder, drinking some water.<br />
Littletato and Julia heard some cars pass by, and also some planes, they liked to stay close to nature.<br />
Julia looked at her phone, thirty minutes already passed, she paused the music.<br />
Littletato and her got up, they walked inside the house, closing the glass door.<br />
Julia put her phone to charge a little in her bedroom, Littletato and her prepared themselves to go to the park.<br />
Littletato opened the locker app on her phone to check if the front door was locked, it was.<br />
After that, Littletato pocketed her phone, her and Julia walked to the kitchen, they both grabbed their water bottles inside the TPF fridge.<br />
Julia walked to the bedroom and grabbed her phone, they both got outside the house, Littletato locked the door with the locker app.<br />
She sent a message in the chat group of the mansion saying that she and Julia were going for a walk in the park.<br />
Yam replied saying okay, he said that he was in the mall with his friends.<br />
Littletato and Julia started walking to the park, Littletato pocketed her phone, it was good to feel the sun in the morning, it was eight and a half AM.<br />
<br />
After walking for a little, they arrived at the park, Julia and Littletato sat on the grass, looking at nature, the trees.<br />
There were some mothers with their children, they left their children playing in the park, playing Frisbee and other games.<br />
Julia and Littletato laid on the grass, looking at the sky and sun, they turned to look at each other, kissing romantically.<br />
Littletato was caressing Julia's hair, hugging her with her eyes closed.<br />
"I love you, honey," said Julia.<br />
"I love you too, hon," said Littletato.<br />
They also drank some sips of their water bottles.<br />
Littletato and Julia took a picture in the park, close to the trees, they were happy at that moment, some minutes had passed.<br />
After that, they got up, they started walking back to the mansion.<br />
"Hey, honey, what do you think of a milkshake?" asked Julia.<br />
"That sounds delicious hon, hehe," replied Littletato.<br />
Then they started walking to an ice cream shop that existed close to the park.<br />
Littletato ordered a chocolate milkshake with Ovomaltine, Julia had ordered a strawberry milkshake.<br />
They sat at the table to wait, after some minutes, their order arrived, they started to drink their milkshakes.<br />
It was very delicious and cold, Littletato took a picture of her milkshake to post on her Vegesapp status.<br />
After that, they finished drinking their milkshakes, Littletato walked to the counter to pay.<br />
It was $1.99 for each shake, being $3.99 in total, after that, Littletato and Julia started walking back to the mansion.<br />
Then, after walking for some minutes, they arrived home, Littletato opened the front door with the locker app.<br />
Julia and Littletato entered inside the house, closing the front door.<br />
They both registered how much water they drank using an app on their phones, they stored their water bottles inside the fridge.<br />
Littletato left her phone charging on the wall socket of the bedroom.<br />
"I'm gonna take a bath honey, what do you want to do?" asked Littletato, who was sat on the bed.<br />
"Oh, I want to play a game with you, maybe Overcooked 2, can we bathe together?" asked Julia.<br />
"Of course honey, hehe," replied Littletato, she got up and locked the door of the bedroom.<br />
Then they prepared themselves to take a bath, entering the bathroom.<br />
The couple started taking a bath together, it was nine AM.<br />
<br />
Yam was driving his car, he was with two friends of his, they already got out of the mall, they were watching a movie at the movie theater.<br />
The boy was driving to the house of their friends, he left them there and said bye to them.<br />
After that, he started driving back to the mansion.<br />
Yam owned the house where he lived before moving to the mansion, he put it to rent to earn some money.<br />
After some minutes of driving, Yam arrived at the mansion, he parked his car inside the garage.<br />
Then he got out of the car, locking it with the car keys and locking the garage door.<br />
He walked inside the mansion and walked to his bedroom, leaving the keys of his car on the keychain.<br />
After that, he started taking a bath, he was a little tired, it was nine and forty AM.<br />
Littletato and Julia finished their bath, they got out of the bathroom and wore some comfortable clothes.<br />
Then, they walked to the kitchen, Littletato got an apple from the fridge, Julia picked up her water bottle.<br />
The couple walked to the living room, Littletato grabbed her controller and the controller of Julia, giving it to her.<br />
She turned the Vbox One on, waiting for it to initialize, then she typed her local password with the controller buttons.<br />
After that, Littletato opened the Overcooked 2 game to play along with Julia, they started to play.<br />
They had to make some sushi on the game, prepare the dishes to serve the clients which were bread demons.<br />
Yam had finished his bath, he got out of the bathroom inside of his bedroom, wearing some comfortable clothes.<br />
Then, he walked outside his room, walking to the living room, seeing Littletato and Julia.<br />
"Hey, guys," said Yam, who sat on the couch, looking at the couple.<br />
"Hey," said Littletato and Julia in unison, looking at Yam.<br />
"Do you guys wanna have lunch together?" asked Yam.<br />
"Yeah, that would be good, let's have it at ten AM?" asked Julia, looking at Yam.<br />
"Oh, okay, I'm gonna go back to my room to stay at my computer a little, I'll get back here when it's ten AM," said Yam, getting up.<br />
"Okay," said Littletato, smiling at Yam.<br />
Then Yam walked back to his room, turning his computer on and sitting on his chair.<br />
He opened YouTube to watch some videos, he had his water bottle close to him.<br />
Littletato and Julia continued playing more levels of the game.<br />
<br />
After some time playing and watching, Littletato, Julia, and Yam stopped doing what they were doing, it was ten AM.<br />
Littletato turned the video game off, Julia and Littletato walked to the kitchen.<br />
Yam closed the web browser and left his computer downloading some things.<br />
He walked to the living room, did not found Littletato and Julia, then walked to the kitchen.<br />
"So, what do you want for lunch?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Oh, I'll want some rice, beans, an artificial salad, and some artificial beef," replied Yam.<br />
"Okay, hehe," said Littletato, smiling, who opened the fridge, there were three plates with some warm rice, and beans, and also some artificial salad and artificial beef.<br />
It looked delicious, some smoke was coming out of it, the smoke of heat.<br />
"What for drinking?" asked Julia, Littletato grabbed the three plates and placed them on top of the table.<br />
"Oh, maybe some Coca-cola? Hehe," replied Yam.<br />
"Sure, hehe," said Julia, who opened the fridge and grabbed the two-liter bottle of Coca-cola.<br />
She placed the bottle on top of the table, Yam grabbed the three glasses and placed them beside the plates.<br />
Yam then sat on the chair, looking at his plate, Littletato also sat at her chair.<br />
Julia was standing, she opened the bottle of Coca-cola and served Littletato and Yam, then filled her glass with Coca-cola.<br />
"It's good to serve like this right? Not getting the filled cups from the fridge," said Julia, smiling, leaving the bottle on the table and sitting.<br />
"Yeah, and it's good to eat with friends, not alone, hehe," said Yam.<br />
"Yes, hehe," said Littletato, they started to eat together, hunger is the best spice, eating with friends is a good one too.<br />
The food was very delicious, Yam liked to eat with his friends.<br />
"So, what did you do today, Yam?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Oh, I watched a movie with my friends at the mall, and also hang out with them around the city.<br />
Then I came back here, talked to you guys, and spent some time watching some YouTube videos," replied Yam.<br />
"That's interesting, hehe, me and Littletato made a walk to the park, and we got milkshakes, hehe," said Julia.<br />
"Oh, that's good, you sure love to eat, right Julia?" asked Yam, smiling a little.<br />
"Yeah, hehe," replied Julia.<br />
Then they finished eating, Littletato, Julia, and Yam spent their day in the mansion, playing, watching, eating.<br />
And sometimes playing with Lisa, the dog.<br />
Lisa, the human, was in her LonelyShip, playing some games, and also writing a little.<br />
Vitória was visiting her family in New York, Carol was visiting her parents in Los Angeles.<br />
<br />
(I loved to write this chapter, it was very good, hehe, it was good to write about the day that everyone had off.<br />
It was good to write about Littletato and Julia walking to the park and getting milkshakes.<br />
Talking about the New Year's Eve of Littletato and Julia.<br />
About Yam watching a movie with his friends and coming back to the mansion.<br />
The bath of the couple, and they playing a little on the Vbox One.<br />
I loved to write about Littletato, Julia, and Yam having lunch together.<br />
It's sad that when you have a TPF fridge and everyone can eat at any time, people do not always eat together.<br />
But I am happy that they ate together in this chapter.<br />
And also, "Lisa, the human" xD.)

		It was a Monday in July of 2021, Littletato woke up, got out of bed, and did her morning needs in the bathroom of the bedroom.<br />
Littletato walked to the kitchen, it was six AM, Littletato grabbed two cheeseburgers and two cups of chocolate milk.<br />
She placed the plates and cups on the kitchen table, she did not felt bad eating the cheeseburgers because they were not made of meat, they were nutrients.<br />
A pizza slice would be nutrients and a little mass with pizza taste, smell, and texture.<br />
The particles on the food could change the nutrients that are in it, but could not change the taste, smell, or texture, that was pre-built into the food.<br />
Julia woke up and walked to the bathroom of the bedroom to do her morning needs.<br />
Littletato remembered that she talked with the SpaceLiving version of Izaque yesterday through Discord.<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque said that he was doing a Visual Onomatopoeia video on the Sony Vegas video editing program.<br />
He explained how he did the video, what images were used, and the ideas that he had.<br />
Littletato was so happy to have a father that was so talented and creative, she was proud of him.<br />
The girl thought that it was weird to have a father that is younger than her, she has twenty-one in 2021, and Izaque has nineteen.<br />
She sat at the table, thinking about that, she wished to see Earth Izaque, the Earth version of her father, from another universe.<br />
Then, Julia finished doing her morning needs, she walked to the kitchen of the mansion.<br />
Julia sat at the table, they started eating breakfast, the cheeseburger was delicious, the chocolate milk too.<br />
Yam appeared there, he grabbed something to eat and sat at the table to eat with the couple, they said hi to Yam, he said hi back.<br />
"Hey, honey, what you were thinking about? You seemed so lost in your mind, hehe," asked Julia, giggling a little.<br />
"Oh, I was thinking about the conversation I had with SpaceLiving Izaque yesterday, he said he was doing a Visual Onomatopoeia video.<br />
He explained to me how he did the video and stuff, and I was proud of him, proud to have a creative and talented father.<br />
I thought that I wanted to see my father, Earth Izaque, he lives in another universe, I think I already told you that," replied Littletato.<br />
"You already told me hon, I also wanted to see him, to meet the person that created all of our reality, hehe.<br />
I think we should tell that to Vitória, Lisa, Yam, and the others, right?" asked Julia.<br />
"Oh, I think that's a great idea hon, they're gonna be crazy, haha," said Littletato, giggling a little.<br />
Yam heard that and made a surprised face (O_O), "What?" asked him.<br />
"Yeah, that's it, our entire reality was created by a boy called Izaque, he wrote a story called The Life of Littletato, and then we're born," replied Julia.<br />
"Wow, that's a lot to take in, I wanna know more after I get back from work, and I want to read that story.<br />
Send me the link of the story through Whatsapp, I want to read it in my free moments at work," said Yam.<br />
"Okay, I'll send it to you when I arrive at work," said Littletato.<br />
After some minutes, the couple finished eating, Yam too, the couple registered when they ate using apps on their phones.<br />
Littletato walked to the bedroom, she started preparing herself to go to work.<br />
She was ready after some time, the girl said bye to Julia with a kiss, leaving the mansion and starting driving to work, Julia closed the front door.<br />
Julia saw Yam leaving with his car, probably to go to work, he worked from six AM to six PM.<br />
Then, Littletato arrived there, she parked her car inside the garage of her work.<br />
After that, Littletato got out of her car, entered the building, and made her check-in, walking to her table and starting to work.<br />
<br />
Julia was at home, it was six and thirty AM, she grabbed her water bottle from the TPF fridge in the kitchen.<br />
After that, she walked to the closed yard, saying hi to Lisa, the dog, and sat on the area chair, Julia had her phone in her pocket.<br />
The girl put to play the soundtrack of the Yuru Camp anime, she left her phone on a small desk.<br />
She waited for the time that she could drink water to come, after some minutes, a notification appeared on her phone, saying that she could drink water.<br />
Julia started taking some sips out of her water bottle, it was six and forty AM, she checked if Lisa had food and water, she had.<br />
After that, she grabbed her phone and entered the mansion, walking to her bedroom, she had bought a computer recently.<br />
A very good and fast one, just little Littletato's, she also bought a new and better laptop and sold her older one.<br />
She sat on the chair and turned her computer on, leaving her two-liter water bottle on the floor.<br />
The girl also left her phone charging on the wall socket.<br />
One month ago, Julia had started working on a website called SproutGigs.<br />
People could do virtual jobs like watching a YouTube video, upvoting a post on Reddit, or using a TikTok or Kwai code on their phones.<br />
They would do the jobs and send proofs that they did the job to the employer, the employer would check the proofs and confirm the job, the money would be sent to the profile of the worker.<br />
Workers could withdraw the money when they had at least five dollars on the profile, they could withdrawal to PayPal or other bank accounts.<br />
Everyone could be an employer and post virtual jobs to be made there.<br />
She already got a lot of money from it, she was earning half of her salary on it every month.<br />
Julia did some small jobs on the website, after that, she closed the web browser.<br />
The girl opened the Python script called GamePlayer.py, it was a Python script that Littletato had made to register how much time she spent playing a game.<br />
She selected The Sims 4 game to play, waiting for it to open and turning on the time counter of GamePlayer.<br />
After playing for some time, it was seven and thirty AM, Julia thought about going for a walk in the park.<br />
She grabbed her phone and water bottle, turned off the computer, left the bedroom, and closed its door, Littletato had a spare key for the bedroom.<br />
Then Julia left the house, she closed the front door with the locker app on her phone.<br />
After that, she started walking to the park, looking at the scenery and nature, enjoying the warmth of the sun.<br />
Then, after some minutes of walking, Julia arrived at the park, she sat there, looking at the sky and the sun, drinking some water.<br />
<br />
Yam was at the grocery store where he works, he was at the cashier, no customers were there, he was bored and free.<br />
The boy grabbed his phone and opened Whatsapp, Littletato had sent a message to him, it was the link to her story on Wattpad.<br />
Yam said thanks to Littletato on a message, he clicked the link, waiting for the page to open.<br />
After that, he began reading the first chapter, the story was called "The Life of Littletato", and was created by a user called Stake2.<br />
The writer explained what was his inspiration and why he started writing that story.<br />
He said that it was his first story and that he created it on 05/08/2017.<br />
Yam continued reading, the chapter talked about the moment when Littletato traveled to San Francisco and met Julia, the moment when they started dating.<br />
Littletato had told that to Yam in a little party they had some time, Vitória and Carol were there too.<br />
Yam thought that it was incredible, and unbelievable, "How Stake2, or Izaque, could know about the life of Littletato?" wondered Yam.<br />
He created an account on the website, after that, the boy added the story to his reading list and followed Stake2, he voted on the first chapter of the story.<br />
Yam opened Whatsapp to send a message to Littletato.<br />
"Hey, Tato, do you have Izaque added in Whatsapp or Discord?" asked Yam.<br />
"Oh, yeah, he sent me his number through Discord, so I added him on Whatsapp," replied Littletato after some minutes.<br />
"Hmm, okay, it's that I wanted to see him on the camera, you know.<br />
But I can't call him right now, my boss is gonna be mad," said Yam.<br />
"Oh, okay, we can do a video call with him when we arrive at home.<br />
I and Izaque never saw each other in a video call, so, me, Julia, and you in the video call, what do you think?" asked Littletato.<br />
"I think it's good, okay, I'll tell you when I arrive home, good luck on your job!" replied Yam.<br />
"Good luck to you too, thanks, bye! :D," said Littletato in a message, then she told Julia about the video call.<br />
After that, Yam locked the screen of his phone and stored it in his pocket.<br />
A customer arrived in the store, she walked around it, looking for something to buy.<br />
It was a blond girl, Yam thought that she was very beautiful.<br />
The girl grabbed some hygiene products, after that, she walked to the cashier, placing the products there.<br />
Yam grabbed each one of the products, scanning the bar code of them, the computer made additions to the number on the screen.<br />
The boy continued scanning the bar codes of the products while sometimes looking at the girl, he also placed them on one plastic bag.<br />
"It will be seven forty-nine," said Yam.<br />
"Oh, okay, I'm gonna pay by card," said the girl.<br />
Then Yam grabbed the card machine and placed it on the counter.<br />
The girl inserted her card and typed her password, Yam noticed that the girl had very beautiful hands, she had painted her nails pink.<br />
Then, after some seconds, the girl removed her card, the purchase was completed.<br />
She grabbed the bags, Yam said thanks, the girl said thanks back, she walked out of the store, it was eight and forty AM.<br />
<br />
Julia was already home, she was laying on the bed of her bedroom.<br />
Some hours passed, it was nine and fifty AM, Julia prepared herself to go to work.<br />
After that, she got a bus to go to work, she arrived there, at the Safeway supermarket.<br />
Julia started working, organizing some shelves, and stocking them.<br />
After some hours of working, it was six PM, Littletato, Julia, and Yam finished their jobs.<br />
Yam got his car to go back to the mansion, Littletato too, Julia got a bus to go back home.<br />
They arrived there, they walked to their bedrooms, Littletato and Julia started taking a bath together, Yam too, in the bathroom of his bedroom.<br />
After that, they walked to the kitchen to eat something, Littletato suggested for them to eat some pizza with Coca-cola.<br />
Then Yam grabbed the pizza that was inside the TPF fridge, Littletato grabbed the Coca-cola bottle and three cups.<br />
She filled the cups with Coca-cola, Yam placed the pizza box on top of the table, the trio sat at the table to eat, it was delicious.<br />
As they were eating in a group, the slices of pizza would morph to have the nutrients that the person that picked it up needed.<br />
If Littletato would grab a slice of pizza, it would morph to have the nutrients that she needed, if Julia wanted that one, it would morph to have the nutrients that Julia needed.<br />
After some time, they finished eating, Littletato and Julia registered the time when they ate using an app on their phones as always.<br />
The trio walked to the living room, they sat on the couch, Littletato unlocked the screen of her phone and opened Whatsapp.<br />
She searched for the contact of Izaque, calling him, after some seconds, he answered the call.<br />
"Heey, my dear," said Izaque in the video call.<br />
"Hey, daddy, I wanted to talk with you, hehe," said Littletato.<br />
"Oh, me too, we never talked in a video call right? Who you got there with you?" asked Izaque.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, it's good to see you on camera, I got Yam," replied Littletato, who turned the camera to face Yam, "And Julia," said her, who turned the camera to face Julia.<br />
Yam and Julia said hi to Izaque, looking at him.<br />
<br />
"Aww, it's so good to see your faces moving, hehe, I'm so happy," said Izaque, looking like he was going to happy cry.<br />
"Oh, don't cry daddy, I love you," said Littletato, looking sad at Izaque.<br />
"I love you too my dear," said Izaque, beginning to smile a little.<br />
"So, you created our reality right?" asked Yam.<br />
"Yeah, I did, I think I explained that on the first chapter of The Life of Littletato," replied Izaque.<br />
"Oh, I understand, I was shocked when I knew that you created our reality.<br />
This morning, Littletato and Julia were talking about you, they looked like they didn't notice that I was there, haha.<br />
And they said that you created our entire reality," said Yam, giggling a little.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, I was so proud of creating you guys and writing that story, hehe.<br />
And that I made it possible for Littletato and Carol to reunite with their forgotten brothers," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, I have a great life, and I'm happy with it, so, thanks, Izaque," said Yam to him.<br />
"No problem, Yam," said Izaque.<br />
"So, what are you doing right now, Izaque?" asked Julia, Littletato turned the phone to face Julia.<br />
"I'm just talking with you guys, laying at my bed, hehe, I was programming in Python a little," replied Izaque.<br />
"Oh, so you created the Watch and GamePlayer Python scripts right?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, they are very useful to me," replied Izaque.<br />
"Hehe, you're very talented daddy, those scripts are genius," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
"Thanks, baby," said Izaque, smiling.<br />
"We're gonna do something else right now, okay daddy?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Okay baby, lateers," replied Izaque, waving his hand.<br />
"Lateers," said Littletato, Julia, and Yam, then Littletato clicked on the end call button, it was six and thirty PM.<br />
"So, are you happy to meet your creator?" asked Littletato, looking at Yam.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, I'm happy to know where I came from and stuff, maybe I can ask him for things?<br />
Like, thinking about what I want, and then he'll listen to my thoughts?" asked Yam.<br />
"Oh, I don't think he knows how to read minds, Yam, you should try to ask him what you want, talking with him through Whatsapp, I'll send you his contact.<br />
Maybe he has some sort of inter-dimensional connector that connects his Internet with the Internet of other dimensions or universes.<br />
Maybe he can send messages to fictional universes like stories, anime, and cartoons.<br />
Or maybe I'm thinking too much, hehe," said Littletato, smiling.<br />
(Well, in reality, it is something just like that, Littletato, oops, sharing private information, hehe, closing connection\\\\ *bzzt*.)<br />
"Oh, maybe it's something like that, anyway, I'm gonna go play something in my room, okay?<br />
See you later guys," said Yam.<br />
"See you later," said Littletato and Julia in unison.<br />
After that, Littletato sent the contact of Izaque to Yam through Whatsapp, she turned the Xbox One on, grabbing her controller and Julia's.<br />
They began to play a game together, it was six and forty PM.<br />
The couple spent their day playing, eating, and drinking water when they need, Yam spent his day in his room.<br />
He played a lot of games, and also checked some news on YouTube and Twitter.

The two women opened the TPF fridge, grabbed the two plates with pizza slices and the two cups with Coca-cola, they sat at the table to eat together.<br />
Only them were going to eat those pizza slices, so the slices would not change their nutrients, they were pre-made with the nutrients that Vitória and Carol needed.<br />
They were talking while eating, asking things, and talking about what they are going to do today.<br />
Lisa, Ted, and Monika were waking up on their spaceships, they LonelyShips.<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque too, the quartet did their morning necessities, Lisa and Izaque drank some water, after that, they ate something while listening to a calm and relaxing ambient song mix on YouTube.<br />
Ted and Monika also had a Compact Space Door on their LonelyShips, just like SpaceLiving Izaque.<br />
(The Compact Space Door was a door that could bring someone to a place that was compressed to the width of the door.<br />
Making it possible to the owner of the door to open it and enter inside the place that was after the door, without occupying too much space with the place.<br />
Space after the door was a type of space that did not occupy physical space, it was the width of the door.)<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque had sent his Compact Space place to Ted and Monika, it was a plain terrain with natural grass, flowers, plants, trees, and a natural lake.<br />
His two dogs were there, Nega and Pingo, Nega was a female dog, and Pingo was a male dog, Pingo was the son of Nega.<br />
(The Compact Space does not come with the two dogs, just so you know, during the translation, it hinted at this for me xD.) <br />
Ted and Monika had already eaten, they walked to their natural place, passing by the Compact Space Door.<br />
They had some area chairs there, to relax in the cool wind and to feel the sun.<br />
The place had an opening that had protection for air to not escape, it was an opening for the sun to shine and hit the whole place.<br />
Lisa and Izaque registered when they ate using Python scripts on their computers, they opened their web browsers and started doing their daily things.<br />
Izaque wanted to write something today, for at least thirty minutes, after that, he was going to do something from his to-do list.<br />
Lisa was drawing a little, continuing a drawing of her, after that, she was going to try to produce a song on FL Studio 20, a digital audio workstation.<br />
<br />
The people on the Mansion of Littletato and Friends finished eating, the pizza was delicious, it was seven AM.<br />
Littletato and Julia registered when they ate, the quintet walked to the living room, they sat on the couch.<br />
Only Littletato, Julia, and Yam knew that it was Earth Izaque that created The Life of Littletato and gave birth to the life of Yam and the others.<br />
Julia and Littletato told that to Vitória and Carol, they were shocked.<br />
The two wanted to see Izaque on camera and ask him questions.<br />
Littletato grabbed her phone and opened Whatsapp, she searched for the contact of Izaque and called him.<br />
Izaque answered the call, it was a video call, Vitória and Carol talked with Izaque and asked him questions.<br />
They were happy to talk with him, because they have a great and happy life, and were happy to meet him, their creator.<br />
The two thanked Izaque for creating them and giving so many things and happiness to them.<br />
After some minutes of talking, Littletato and the others said bye to Izaque, he said bye back.<br />
Littletato turned the Xbox One on, she had four controllers for it, they were going to play a game together.<br />
Unfortunately, the coop games only accepted up to four players on the same console.<br />
Julia chose the Overcooked 2 game to play, Julia, Vitória, Littletato, and Carol played together, only the girls, Yam just watched.<br />
He was with his phone, Yam was playing some Call of Duty: Mobile on his phone while waiting for his time to play.<br />
Yam looked at the screen sometimes to watch the game, the girls made funny things, and sometimes threw food out of the level of the game.<br />
They had fun, Yam, too, laughing sometimes while watching them play.<br />
After some levels, Yam was going to play, Julia gave the controller to Yam, the quartet started playing, Julia said that she was going to check if Lisa had food.<br />
She walked to the closed yard and got outside, walking to the automatic dog feeder of Lisa, she was almost without water and dog food.<br />
Julia walked inside, the door to the closed yard was in the kitchen, Julia opened the fridge and grabbed some dog food.<br />
After that, the girl walked to the closed yard, she filled the automatic dog feeder with dog food.<br />
Then she made the same with water, grabbing mineral water from the fridge.<br />
She walked back to the living room, they were still playing, it was fun to watch them play.<br />
Julia grabbed her phone and started playing a game on it, it was seven and thirty AM.<br />
The girl said that she was going to get some sun on the closed yard, she got up and walked to the closed yard, getting outside and sitting on an area chair.<br />
<br />
Julia was playing a game about a candy land, you had to build some candy machines to make candy, the name of the game was Candy Factory.<br />
And you had to build pump jacks to extract liquid chocolate from the underground, to make chocolate bars.<br />
You had to hire airplane pilots with specialized airplanes to fly and collect the raw cotton from the skies to make cotton candy, the raw cotton looked like clouds.<br />
The person just had to add sugar, a powder to make it softer, and add food dye to paint it.<br />
The player hired miners to mine sugar gems to make gobstoppers (jawbreakers), they were made on the Candyfacture (candy factory).<br />
You could also make candy canes in the Candyfacture using a different version of the Keller Machine, which automated the process of twisting soft cane into spiral striping and cutting it into precise lengths as candy canes.<br />
Then, you could sell the candies and chocolates that you made to another planet, which loved candy, they ate candy and chocolate every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br />
Julia was happy to play that game, it was very good, and a little addicting.<br />
She was happy to know that she was able to expand her Candy Factory further, and own more lands that have natural candy resources.<br />
The game also had a Candy Research Center, which discovered new candies to be made using the natural candy resources that the land provided.<br />
The gems, which were used to make gobstoppers and lollipops, the liquid chocolate extracted from the underground was used to made chocolate bars.<br />
Also, the raw cotton clouds were used to make cotton candy.<br />
Julia could mine ores from caves to make lollipops too, she loved to play that game.<br />
The girl could get liquid white cream from some lakes to heat it and make marshmallows.<br />
She could use honey, sugar, and edible glue to make bubblegum.<br />
Julia also has to build spaceships and hire pilots to bring the candies to the other planet, the City Planet.<br />
It was very good, she had a lot of spaceships coming and getting out of the big Candy Rocket Launch Complex, it had a lot of LaunchPads.<br />
She also had to hire rocket builders and operators, it was where she used a lot of money, she hired a contractor of spaceship staff to hire the workers for her.<br />
The workers came from the City Planet, which was all a city, they had water generators and good seam machines, they had a great electronics manufacturing speed.<br />
The planet where Julia build her machines and her factory was the Candy Planet, she owned it all, but there were other Candy Planets, and they also sold candies to the City Planet.<br />
So Julia had some competition.<br />
Julia was playing the game on her phone, sitting on an area chair of the closed yard.<br />
The game showed a message to her, "Hey, do you want to teleport to your Candyfacture?" asked the message, Julia found that message weird.<br />
Julia was managing the Candy Rocket Launch Complex, which was a little far from her Candyfacture, she clicked on accept because she wanted to go there.<br />
Lisa, the dog, was closed to Julia, when she clicked accept, a gold portal with a dark center appeared on the physical screen of her phone, it was eight AM.<br />
Julia and Lisa were sucked by the portal, they entered inside the phone, into the game.<br />
<br />
Julia was there, inside her Candyfacture, it was all so real, the machines, the smell, the touch, the sounds.<br />
"Have I been teleported to the game?" asked herself, she looked at the ground, "Oh, Lisa, you're here too," said Julia, grabbing Lisa and putting her on her chest.<br />
She had a phone in her pocket, it was her phone, but it did not have the candy game installed.<br />
Someone called her on the phone, she answered it.<br />
"Hey, boss, we discovered a new recipe for candy, it uses some rare gems from a mine on this planet.<br />
Do you want to try it? You can also hire more miners to mine those rare gems," asked a woman on the phone, she was probably from the Candy Research Center.<br />
"Oh, okay, I'll go there to try," replied Julia, they said bye to each other.<br />
Then Julia looked for a specific contact on her contact list, there was a contact called "Miner Manager", she called him and told him to focus on the rare gems and sent him the location of the cave.<br />
The Miner Manager managed the miners and told them where to mine first.<br />
There was also a maid there, she had blond hair and wore a French maid costume.<br />
"Hey, boss, you know that you have a house here right?<br />
If you want, I can bring Lisa there, to stay in the closed yard, my name is Frederica by the way." said the maid.<br />
"Oh, okay, thanks, I'm gonna miss you, Lisa, hehe," said Julia, caressing Lisa's fur and putting her nose on her, smelling her.<br />
Then Julia gave Lisa to the maid, she started walking to the house of Julia, it was not very far, Julia could see it.<br />
The house was made with candies and stuffed cookies, it also had some whipped cream and melted chocolate.<br />
Julia noticed that the Candy Land did not have any cars, only planes, and spaceships.<br />
She wanted to buy some good cars from the City Planet to make her workers work faster because they travel faster from where they work to the warehouse.<br />
The miners could travel by car, from the mines and caves to the warehouse to store the ores and gems.<br />
The pump jack operators could bring more liquid chocolate on their cars than by foot.<br />
She discovered that the City Planet ate candies because it was the only thing that they had to eat, their planet did not have soil or animals to make food.<br />
They extinguished all of the animals and soil that existed there, everything was dead, they had highly technological cities.<br />
People there only had candies to eat, and it was healthy for them, so they needed the Candy Planets to feed them.<br />
Julia had some money left, some millions, she bought fifty cars and also hired a civil engineer to construct roads on the Candy Land.<br />
She also hired a crew of constructors to make houses on a specific part of the planet, away from the Candyfacture.<br />
The girl hired more constructors to build a wall around the whole factory, and build an airport for airplanes.<br />
She was happy to build a lot of things on the game, or the Candy Factory universe, that she could not on the phone game.<br />
Julia was making a lot of progress, she was happy, and gaining some money.<br />
Her workers, miners, pump jack operators, and honey collectors could make spaceship trips to the City Planet to learn how to drive a car and to get a driver's license.<br />
<br />
Littletato and the others finished playing, they ate something, Littletato walked to the closed yard to search for Julia.<br />
She did not found her nor Lisa, but she found Julia's phone on top of an area chair, she grabbed it.<br />
The girl looked at the screen, she saw Julia inside the game, "Honey, are you there?" asked Littletato, scared.<br />
"Yes, I'm here honey, don't worry," replied Julia, her voice came from the phone speaker.<br />
"How did you get in there?" asked Littletato.<br />
"Well, the game asked if I wanted to teleport to my Candy Factory, and it was far away from the Candy Rocket Launch Complex, so I accepted.<br />
I thought it was going to teleport my character to the factory, not me.<br />
Then a gold portal appeared on the screen of the phone, Lisa was close to me, we were sucked into the game together," replied Julia.<br />
"Oh, Lisa is there, where is she?" asked Littletato, getting relieved that Lisa is there.<br />
"She is at my candy house, on the closed yard," replied Julia, pointing to her house.<br />
"Wow, hehe, I also wanted to go there to eat some candies with you, it sounds delicious, hehe," said Littletato.<br />
Then a gold portal appeared on the physical screen of the phone, it started rotating, just like it did when it sucked Julia and Lisa to the game.<br />
"No, no, not yet, I still have to tell the others," said Littletato, not wanting to be sucked into the game.<br />
The portal stopped rotating, it then disappeared, "Oh, looks like it understands English, haha," said Littletato.<br />
Then she got up and closed the door, she walked to the trio, Yam, Vitória, and Carol, they were in the living room.<br />
Carol and Vitória were surprised by seeing Julia on the game, she explained what happened.<br />
"After knowing that Izaque created our reality, nothing surprises me more, hehe," said Yam.<br />
Littletato said that she was going to leave the phone charging and was going to enter inside the game.<br />
She said that to the trio so they do not get worried.<br />
The trio walked to their bedrooms, Littletato too, she locked the door of it and left the phone charging on top of the computer table.<br />
"I want to go there to eat candies with you hon, hehe," said Littletato, smiling while looking at the screen.<br />
The gold portal appeared on the screen and started rotating, after some seconds, Littletato was inside the game.<br />
The couple spent their day on the game, they did not have to drink water or sleep there but could get physically tired.<br />
They could eat the candy and it would be good for them, it would have nutrients.<br />
Littletato helped Julia manage the Candy Factory and Candy Land, they made some decisions together.<br />
Julia and Littletato decided to make train lines to bring ores, gems, liquid white cream, and liquid chocolate to the warehouse to make candies.<br />
The couple was happy to eat a lot of candies together, they were eating the candies in the living room of Julia's house, watching a series on the TV.

		It was a Monday, in September of 2021, Littletato had to work today, she got up at five and a half AM.<br />
Julia got up too, they did their morning necessities in the bathroom of the bedroom and also took a bath.<br />
The couple walked to the kitchen to eat, they grabbed healthy vegan hamburgers and some natural orange juice without sugar.<br />
They ate and drank, it was very delicious, the orange juice was good without sugar.<br />
After that, they finished eating, the two registered when they ate using apps on their phones.<br />
Then, Littletato started preparing herself to go to work.<br />
Julia hugged her and kissed her lips, "I love you, hon," said her.<br />
"I love you too, honey," said Littletato, who kissed Julia's lips back.<br />
Littletato then finished preparing herself, she grabbed the keys of her car in the bedroom and walked to the garage.<br />
She entered the car and turned it on, Julia said bye to her with a kiss, Littletato said bye back.<br />
The girl got out of the mansion with her car, it was raining a little, with some thunders.<br />
Julia liked to hear the thunders and the raindrops falling on the roof of the house.<br />
Littletato had closed the door of the garage with the control in her hands.<br />
Then Julia walked back inside the house, she walked to her bedroom and grabbed her phone which was charging.<br />
She laid on the bed, opened Whatsapp, she texted Izaque, the name of the contact on her phone was Earth Izaque.<br />
"Hey, Izaque, can I also call you daddy?" asked Julia in her message.<br />
"Of course, Julia, you're my baby too, hehe :3," replied Izaque.<br />
"Hehe, okay, daddy, thanks for doing that to me, the thing on the Candy Factory game," said Julia.<br />
"No problem baby, hehe, I like to write about those fantasy stuff, it's cool, like, it's something that is away from reality.<br />
I guess I don't like reality much, the normal stuff, working, eating, sleeping, getting leisure, I don't like to write about that too much," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, I agree, daddy, I don't like that too, the normal stuff, I love living with Tato and the others, but I also like to have some fantasy stuff too, to dream, hehe," said Julia.<br />
"Hehe, I can always write about you living inside a fantasy if you want, baby," said Izaque.<br />
"I would love that daddy!" said Julia, with a smiling emoji.<br />
"So, I'm going to write something a little, talk to you later, baby," said Izaque.<br />
"Oh, okay, it's it The Life of Littletato? :3" asked Julia.<br />
"Yeah, hehe *hugs you*," replied Izaque.<br />
"*Hugs back*, okay, baay daddy :3," said Julia.<br />
"Baay :3," said Izaque.<br />
<br />
Then Julia locked the screen of her phone, she looked at the ceiling of the bed, it was some kind of cloth, with purple curtains around it.<br />
She got up and walked to the wall socket close to the computer table, leaving her phone there to charge.<br />
The girl turned her computer on, walked to the kitchen, and saw Vitória there.<br />
"Hey, big sis," said Julia.<br />
"Hey little sis," said Vitória.<br />
Julia grabbed her water bottle from the fridge.<br />
Vitória was sitting on the kitchen table, eating a sandwich, she had her laptop on top of the table.<br />
"What are you doing, big sis?" asked Julia, who walked close to Vitória, looking at the screen of the laptop.<br />
"I'm making the new logo and visual identity for a startup company of technology, they offer services like software coding and chipset manufacture," replied Vitória.<br />
"Oh, that sounds interesting, hehe, send me the logo when you finish it, big sis," said Julia, who hugged Vitória.<br />
"Okay, I'll send it to you, little sis," said Vitória.<br />
Julia then walked back to the bedroom, she closed the door and sat at the computer chair, it was six and ten AM.<br />
She opened the SproutGigs website to work a little, she almost had ten dollars.<br />
Carol had already eaten breakfast, she was in her room using her computer, she also had a laptop.<br />
The girl was making the diet of a customer of her.<br />
She was using her laptop, she closed it and placed it between her arm and her chest.<br />
Carol walked out of the bedroom and walked to Julia's room.<br />
The girl knocked on the door, "Hey," said her.<br />
Julia got up and walked to the door, she opened it.<br />
"Hey, Carol," said Julia, smiling.<br />
"Hey, I wanted to ask if I could stay with you, I'm feeling a little lonely..." said Carol.<br />
"Oh, of course, come on in," said Julia.<br />
"Thanks, Julia," said Carol, who entered inside the bedroom.<br />
"Can I sit at the bed?" asked Carol.<br />
"Yes, hehe, can I close the door?" asked Julia.<br />
"Yeah," replied Carol, who sat at the bed, she placed the laptop on her lap, opening it.<br />
Then Julia closed the door, she sat beside Carol, "Do you want a hug?" asked Julia, looking at Carol.<br />
"Yes, please," replied Carol, leaving the laptop on the side.<br />
Julia then hugged Carol, smiling, "Thanks, Julia," said Carol, "No problem, hehe," said Julia.<br />
Then Julia got up and walked to the computer, she continued working on the SproutGigs website for some minutes, it was six and thirty AM.<br />
She closed the website, she was using the Mozilla Firefox web browser.<br />
<br />
Julia opened the Paint Tool SAI program on her computer.<br />
She started drawing something, it was an anime girl, Lisa had taught her how to draw faces, bodies, and how to do the anime drawing style.<br />
"This looks good, Julia, hehe," said Carol, smiling, Julia turned the chair to face Carol, "Really?" asked her.<br />
"Yeah, hehe, sorry for like, spying on your computer," replied Carol.<br />
"No, it's okay, hehe, and thanks," said Julia, smiling.<br />
"No problem, hehe," said Carol, Julia then rotated the chair back to where it was, she continued making the drawing.<br />
Yam was at the grocery store where he works.<br />
The blond girl that appeared in the store on that Monday in July kept coming to the store to buy things.<br />
The boy was happy to see her every day, they even talked a little sometimes.<br />
Yam felt sad when she did not appear in the store, he was used to seeing her every day.<br />
Vitória came back to her bedroom after she finished eating breakfast, she continued making the logo and finished it, it was seven AM.<br />
Littletato was still at work, programming a little, she was coding a fast-food delivery app for a company called IFood.<br />
Julia had finished her drawing, she saved it, and closed the drawing program, she still had to post it on DeviantArt.<br />
She said to Carol that she was going to play some "Call of Duty: Warzone" on her computer and that the game had a loud sound, and she was going to use the headphones.<br />
Carol said okay to her, saying that she was going to give her a pat on the back if she needed something, Julia said okay.<br />
Then Julia opened the game and selected the Warzone (Battle Royale) mode, she started playing it.<br />
Carol had finished making the diet of her customer, she opened the Grammarly website on her laptop.<br />
The girl started writing an essay about the Vegan lifestyle, and why Veganism is more than a diet.<br />
And also about the effect that creating livestock and eating meat has on global warming.<br />
She was going to post that essay on her blog.<br />
Lisa was writing a little on the Obsidian second-brain software, she was writing a chapter of her story called "The Oddities of Nature".<br />
The girl was happy to write that, she sent a draft of the chapter to SpaceLiving Izaque to see what he thought of it, she was writing chapter sixteenth.<br />
SpaceLiving Izaque said that it was very good, she was happy to hear that from her friend.<br />
It was still raining a little in San Francisco, Yam was still at the grocery store, he was reading some chapters of "The Life of Littletato" because there were no customers.<br />
Littletato observed the beautiful rain through the window of the building where she works, she liked to hear the rain sounds.<br />
